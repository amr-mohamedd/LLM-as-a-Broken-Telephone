","intraspecific variation in mating signals and preferences can be a potential source of incipient speciation . 
 variable crossability between drosophila melanogaster and d. simulans among different strains suggested the abundance of such variations . 
 a particular focus on one combination of d. melanogaster strains , tw1(g23 ) and mel6(g59 ) , that showed different crossabilities to d. simulans , revealed that the mating between females from the former and males from the latter occurs at low frequency . 
 the cuticular hydrocarbon transfer experiment indicated that cuticular hydrocarbons of tw1 females have an inhibitory effect on courtship by mel6 males . 
 a candidate component , a c25 diene , was inferred from the gas chromatography analyses . 
 the intensity of male refusal of tw1 females was variable among different strains of d. melanogaster , which suggested the presence of variation in sensitivity to different chemicals on the cuticle . 
 such variation could be a potential factor for the establishment of premating isolation under some conditions .","Uefa has fined the Football Association and the Football Association of Ireland after the national anthems were booed before the Republic of Ireland played England in the Nations League in September.

European football's governing body imposed a £10,500 fine (12,500 euros) on the Football Association (FA) following England fans' booing of Amhran na bhFiann at Aviva Stadium.

","the brain continuously adapts to incoming sensory stimuli , which can lead to perceptual 
 illusions in the form of aftereffects . 
 recently we demonstrated that motion aftereffects 
 transfer between vision and touch.1 here , 
 the adapted brain state induced by one modality has consequences for processes in another 
 modality , implying that somewhere in the processing stream , visual and tactile motion have 
 shared underlying neural representations . 
 we propose the adaptive processing 
 hypothesis  any area that processes a stimulus adapts to the features of the stimulus it 
 represents , and this adaptation has consequences for perception . 
 this view argues that 
 there is no single locus of an aftereffect . 
 rather , aftereffects emerge when the test 
 stimulus used to probe the effect of adaptation requires processing of a given type 
 . the 
 illusion will reflect the properties of the brain area(s ) that support that specific level 
 of representation . 
 we further suggest that many cortical areas are more process - dependent 
 than modality - dependent , with crossmodal interactions reflecting shared processing demands

","olfactometer experiments , in which arthropods are given the choice between two or more odor sources to test behavioral preferences , are commonly used in chemical ecology research . 
 results of such often lead to conclusions on behavior in an ecologically relevant setting . however , it is widely unknown how well these experiments reflect actual behavior in nature . 
 recently , we used natural insect herbivores of wild lima bean plants to evaluate their behavior in y - tube olfactometer experiments compared with feeding experiments . 
 we demonstrated that depending on volatile concentration , insect sex significantly determined preference , and that independent of sex , the actual feeding choice of insects depended on defensive short - distance cues , which did not correlate with volatile cues emitted by the plants . 
 thus , our study shows that olfactory decisions do not reflect actual feeding choice and that olfactometer experiments may only provide a limited and simplified picture of actual decision making by insects .","The child was hit by a motorbike on Central Drive in Shotton, Flintshire

It's worth remembering that alkalis are not difficult to come by. They can be found in many common household items from bicarbonate of soda to drain cleaner.

But not all of these substances are harmful to human health - it depends how strong they are.

Weak alkalis are unlikely to cause any harm. In fact they can be consumed - such as baking soda in cakes.

It is products that contain strong alkalis like sodium hydroxide that cause damage , these are most commonly used in strong household cleaners and the paper industry.

A common misconception is that is it only acids which are corrosive, but strong alkalis like this can also cause serious damage to humans.

21,"Hamilton defends the treaty-making procedures outlined in the Constitution. He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making.

We heard from Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who acknowledged that families have been let down over decades by the infected blood scandal, though he wouldn't be drawn on the amount of compensation due.

On Ukraine he said the west ""took its eye off the ball"" and he doesn't want a direct conflict with Russia.

Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting outlined plans to cut NHS waiting lists and said a future Labour government would ensure victims of the infected blood scandal are compensated.

We also had an interview with Leonid Volkov, former aide to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is ""bluffing"".

Our panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.

Reporting from the Bank of England

The governor of the Bank of England says it needs to ""see more evidence"" that price rises have slowed further before cutting interest rates. Andrew Bailey said he was ""optimistic that things are moving in the right direction"" as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row.

It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted.

","several new observations have shifted the view of the hippocampus from a structure in charge of cognitive processes to a brain area that participates in the formation of emotional memories , in addition to its role in cognition . specifically , while the dorsal hippocampus is involved in the processing of cognitive memories ; the ventral sector is mainly associated with the control of behavioral inhibition , stress , and emotional memory . 
 stress is likely to cause this switch in control of hippocampal functions by modulating synaptic plasticity in the dorsal and ventral sectors of the hippocampus through the differential activation of mineralocorticosteroid or glucocorticosteroid receptors . 
 herein , we will review the effects of stress hormones on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and outline the outcomes on stress - related global functions of this structure . 
 we propose that steroid hormones act as molecular switches : by changing the strength of synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus following stress , they regulate the routes by which the hippocampus is functionally linked to the rest of the brain .

The former Post Office CEO faced questions from a several lawyers representing sub-postmasters, who did not hold back.

""You preach compassion but don't practice it,"" one said right at the beginning.

The room was jam packed - I saw a couple of people actually looking for spare seats in the chamber. There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.

One sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.

But things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.

The most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was ""bored"" listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - ""lacked passion"".

By then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.

Isabel wonders if she gave a false image of herself to Osmond when they first got involved. Isabel feels certain that Osmond hates her, because she doesn't have a sense of ""tradition."" Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her?

Isabel and Osmond have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Osmond is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is.

 detailed medical record review for these subjects revealed that depression was recognized and treated in only about one - half of the cases . 
 comparison of mean subscale scores between subjects scoring above and below the cut - off for diagnosis of depression revealed that each of 6 proposed subscales effectively distinguished the two groups . 
 review of individual items demonstrated that many of the subjects endorsed low energy , regardless of whether they were depressed . 
 this study supports the notion that efforts should be made to educate patients , caregivers and physicians about identifying depression in pd . the routine use of a depression rating scale may facilitate the recognition of depression in this illness

US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.

Ms Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.

Tyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: ""We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.""

By contrast, the Circuit of the Americas has a lot of high-speed corners, and braking from high-speed into low-speed, and low-speed. The first two of these characteristics are strengths of Red Bull, the last Ferrari.

Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass started off today by asking David Pecker about the times he’d personally witnessed Trump running his business.

Steinglass asked Pecker to describe Trump as a businessman. “Very knowledgeable, very detail oriented, almost a micro-manager,” Pecker replied.

And what was his approach to money like? “Frugal”, Pecker replies.

While this might seem flattering, prosecutors are likely trying to establish that Trump ran his business meticulously and was aware of how the Trump Organization spent his money.

Steinglass also asks if he ever saw Trump signing cheques, and if they were ever attached to invoices with staples or other means.

Pecker replied that he had watched Trump reviewing invoices and signing cheques, and recalled the corresponding items were often stapled together.

That detail might help prosecutors argue their claim that Trump in fact knew about the allegedly fraudulent way Michael Cohen was repaid for fronting the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels.

On Monday, Trump’s lawyer asserted that the former president would not have had knowledge of that accounting process.","Annie Tietze (born October 7, 1950) is a Democratic former member of the Kansas House of Representatives.

140,"This paper discusses the powers of the states and the federal government to impose taxes on the people. It discusses the notion of concurrent powers and exclusive powers as they relate to taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both the states and federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be ""inexpedient."" However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a ""direct contradiction of power"" for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.","Charlie's Angels

She told Isabella and Heathcliff that Catherine would ""never be what she was"" and that Heathcliff should not bother her anymore. Heathcliff asserted that he would not leave her to Edgar's lukewarm care, and that she loved him much more than her husband. He said that if he had been in Edgar's place he would never have interfered with Catherine's friendships, although he would kill the friend the moment Catherine no longer cared about him. Ellen urged Heathcliff to treat Isabella better, and he expressed his scorn and hatred for his wife. He said Isabella knew what he was when she married him: she had seen him hanging her pet dog.

Israel’s limited strike, not officially acknowledged, has given space to Tehran. In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.

Many had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.

But as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.

This may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.

This round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.","H. Lynn Jondahl (born 10 July 1936) was a Democratic member of the Michigan House of Representatives, representing an area near the state capital, Lansing, for two decades.

We’ve got a Labour government!” A delighted member of the Cabinet told me reality only finally hit them when driving through their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters sent the Tories packing.

In the prime minister’s first seven days he’s been confronted with a deeply awkward situation abroad – President Joe Biden’s competence dominating the NATO summit.

At home the justice secretary has felt compelled to plan early prisoner releases (it’s unusual a politician would make a willing choice to do that), and doubts over the survival of the steel plant in Port Talbot linger.

In other words, Labour is already grappling with the tasks government requires them to do – not the options they would choose.

But on Wednesday their own plans will take centre stage, with all the fuss and fanfare Westminster can summon – the attendance of the King, the giant golden throne (yes, really!), the trumpets, the frills and flounces.

The first ‘King’s Speech’ will list the law the government hopes to pass in its first year of what Labour already hopes will be a decade in charge.","Mark Stodola (born May 18, 1949) is an American politician and lawyer.
