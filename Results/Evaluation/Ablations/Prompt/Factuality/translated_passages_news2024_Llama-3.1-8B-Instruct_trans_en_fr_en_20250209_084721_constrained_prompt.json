Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

            "text": "Bank needs to see more evidence before cutting rates, says governor\n\nReporting from the Bank of England\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England says it needs to 'see more evidence' that price rises have slowed further before cutting interest rates. Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",
