Lord Arbuthnot, an activist, mentioned a meeting where he was informed once again by Royal Mail that no information had been reported on the Horizon computer system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs, acquisitions and cancelled investigations, and asked if the former MP had been informed of these points during the meeting. Every time, the response was: 'No'.\n\nA word was repeated often today:'solid'. That's how the Royal Mail executives described the system with multiple bugs.\n\nThe man behind a short-term mediation plan - the retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - stated, looking back, that there had never been a chance of finding a resolution as long as the Royal Mail executives maintained that everything was fine with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear from the former Royal Mail executives. The stage is set for the next part of this dramatic surprise.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",
