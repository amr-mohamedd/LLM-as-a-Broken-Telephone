However, a more in-depth investigation of this case could still surprise us.\n\nIn a four-minute exchange just after 11 o'clock this morning, Lord Arbuthnot, a campaigner, referred to a meeting where he was again informed by Royal Mail that the computer system Horizon had no problems.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs, acquittals and cancelled investigations, and asked the former MP if he had been informed of these problems at the meeting. Each time, the response was: 'no'.\n\nA word was repeated several times today:'solid'. That's how Royal Mail officials described the system with bugs.\n\nThe president of a short-term mediation plan - retired Judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that there had never been a chance of finding a resolution as long as Royal Mail officials maintained that everything was in order with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear from former Royal Mail officials. The scene is set for the next step in this, still shocking, tragedy.",

We're now wrapping up our live coverage.\n\nHis brief testimony lasted just four minutes, which took us all a bit by surprise here in the newsroom.\n\nThe short time on the stand was because Judge Lewis Kaplan had given Trump a very limited scope of what he could talk about. A separate trial last year found Trump sexually assaulted Carroll, so it meant he couldn't repeat his denials and had to stick to what was relevant in the case.\n\nCourt returns tomorrow for closing arguments and the jury to be sent off for deliberations. For a write-up of today, that's here.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",
