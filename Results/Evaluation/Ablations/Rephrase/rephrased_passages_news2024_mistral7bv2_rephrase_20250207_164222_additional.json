Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

Despite maintaining an interest rate of 5.25% for six consecutive meetings, which is the highest it has been in 16 years, Bailey expressed confidence that progress was being made. The bank expects inflation, which represents the rate of price increases, to come close to its 2% target in the forthcoming months. This prediction paves the way for the first rate cut, possibly in June, if inflation continues to decline. Bailey acknowledged the recent encouraging signs regarding inflation, as per official data, which had fallen to 3.2% in the last month.

Despite participating in training the previous day while wearing a mandatory mask according to French team regulations, Mbappe was not part of Didier Deschamps' starting lineup.\n\nBefore the game, Griezmann, another French soccer player, expressed his frustration about Mbappe's absence during press conferences. He emphasized the significance of versatility for the team, saying, 'Mbappe is one of the best players in the world. Our team's success hinges on his involvement. Our strength lies in our ability to adapt.'\n\nRegrettably, for team practice, Mbappe wore a standard protective mask, complying with Uefa guidelines, rather than the decorative one he utilized during rehearsals. Consequently, he was excluded from the squad, with Griezmann and Thuram selected to spearhead the offensive effort.",
