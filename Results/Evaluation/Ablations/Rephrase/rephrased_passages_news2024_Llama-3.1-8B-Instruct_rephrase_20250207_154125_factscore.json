Sean describes his time with Shawn as the most fulfilling period of his life, crediting Shawn with granting him the independence to take charge of his life and regain his autonomy.",

Headley, who currently resides in Ipswich, was identified as the main suspect and subsequently arrested and charged after a recent virtual court hearing at Bristol Magistrates' Court, where he will be taken to the High Court on June 16. It is alleged that Headley committed the crime between June 26 and 29, 1967. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for February 14, during which a request was made to deny Headley bail.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.
