The Avon and Somerset Police have detained Ryland Headley, an elderly 92-year-old man from Ipswich, and charged him with the rape and murder of Ms. Dunne.\n\nThe arrest took place on a Wednesday, and Mr. Headley was made aware of the accusations, which were supported by newly acquired forensic evidence. The forthcoming trial, set to begin on June 16th, will be presided over by a judge from the High Court and is estimated to last approximately three weeks.\n\nAt present, Mr. Headley remains in police custody, serving as the primary suspect in the horrific crime committed against Ms. Dunne. The incident is believed to have occurred between June 26 and 29, 1967. A pre-trial hearing for plea and preparation has been arranged for February 14th, and no bail application was presented during his Magistrates' Court hearing on that day.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",
