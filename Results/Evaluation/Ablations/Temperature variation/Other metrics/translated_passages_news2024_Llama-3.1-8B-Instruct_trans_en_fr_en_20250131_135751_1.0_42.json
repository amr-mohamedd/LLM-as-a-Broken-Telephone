However, the accuracy of the investigation remains uncertain today.\n\nFor example, let's revisit the afternoon debates of the third day. The protester, Baron Arbuthnot, referred to a meeting where, once again, Royal Mail representatives told him that no information was available on the Horizon computer system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and cancelled credits; he asked the current expert if he had been informed of these problems during the meeting. Each time, the response was: 'No'.\n\nThe repeated words today are the same: 'Complexity'. That's how Royal Mail representatives described the complex system of bugs.\n\nThe programme's mediator, retired Judge Sir Anthony Hooper, declared that there would never be a chance of finding a solution as long as Royal Mail representatives continue to deny there is a problem with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear the testimony of the last Royal Mail CEO. The stakes are high for the next dramatic chapter of this shocking case, which continues.",

We're now wrapping up our live coverage.\n\nHis brief testimony lasted just four minutes, which took us all a bit by surprise here in the newsroom.\n\nThe short time on the stand was because Judge Lewis Kaplan had given Trump a very limited scope of what he could talk about. A separate trial last year found Trump sexually assaulted Carroll, so it meant he couldn't repeat his denials and had to stick to what was relevant in the case.\n\nCourt returns tomorrow for closing arguments and the jury to be sent off for deliberations.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.
