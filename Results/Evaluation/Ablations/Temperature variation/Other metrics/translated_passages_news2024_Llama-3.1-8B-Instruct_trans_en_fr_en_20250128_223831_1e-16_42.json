Lord Arbuthnot, a peer, recalled a meeting where he was once again informed by Royal Mail that there was no incident with the computer system Horizon.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs, acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been informed of these elements during the meeting. Each time, the response was: 'no'.\n\nA word was repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. That's how Royal Mail officials described the system with bugs.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-term mediation plan - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that looking back, there was never a chance of resolution as long as Royal Mail's leaders maintained 'robustly' that there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear from Royal Mail's former leaders. The stage has been set for the next stage of this, still shocking, drama.",

Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.
