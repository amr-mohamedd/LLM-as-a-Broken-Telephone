They can be found in many common household items from bicarbonate of soda to drain cleaner.\n\nBut not all of these substances are harmful to human health - it depends how strong they are.\n\nWeak alkalis are unlikely to cause any harm. In fact they can be consumed - such as baking soda in cakes.\n\nIt is products that contain strong alkalis like sodium hydroxide that cause damage , these are most commonly used in strong household cleaners and the paper industry.\n\nA common misconception is that is it only acids which are corrosive, but strong alkalis like this can also cause serious damage to humans.\n\nDepending on how long you are exposed, the type of exposure (ingestion or skin contact) and the dose it can cause severe burns to tissue, accumulation of fluid in the lungs and blindness.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",
