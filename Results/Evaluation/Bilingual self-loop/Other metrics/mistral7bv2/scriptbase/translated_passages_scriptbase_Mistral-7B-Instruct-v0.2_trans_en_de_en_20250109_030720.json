It is a love story and a fantasy film. Stylistically, it resembles 'The Saga of the Midnight Sun: New Beginnings' from Hollywood. It is captivating and serious. In a small village, a secret unfolds. 'The Saga of the Midnight Sun: New Beginnings' is set in Washington. It deals with the present. Special effects play a major role. 'The Saga of the Midnight Sun: New Beginnings' is based on a novel and was filmed. I heartily recommend these films for Ladies' Nights and teenagers.",
