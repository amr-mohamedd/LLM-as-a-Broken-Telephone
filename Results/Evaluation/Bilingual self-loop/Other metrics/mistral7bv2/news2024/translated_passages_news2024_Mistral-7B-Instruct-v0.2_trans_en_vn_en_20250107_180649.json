But the thorough nature of an inquiry like this ensures it can still shock.\n\nTake a four-minute exchange at just after 11 this morning. The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses. The stage has been set for the next act of this, still shocking, drama.",

Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

While per capita GDP is now also up for the first time in two years, it is still lower now than two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turning point? Or will they focus on years of sluggish growth and declining living standards before that?\n\nThe economic hangover from the worst health crisis in a century and the worst energy crisis in a generation was always going to be tough, but the economy now appears to be returning to normal. If sustained, that is a marked improvement.\n\nAnd with that, we're closing our live coverage.

It predates the time of the Biblical King David and King Solomon and is characteristic of the Canaan region on the eastern Mediterranean coast.",

He got lost in treacherous terrain and fell to his death.\n\nHis family hoped the viral frenzy would end when his body was found last week. But it did not.\n\nMany are now asking one question: why did it take 29 days to find him?\n\nWe’ve spent time in Tenerife over the past month inside the search for Jay, reporting on the riddle.\n\nWhat we've seen raises both questions and answers.",

There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.\n\nOne sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.\n\nThe most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was 'bored' listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'lacked passion'.\n\nBy then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.\n\nThank you for joining us today.

The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent.

Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

This, coupled with the lease from Butlin’s ending, meant the restaurant was closed to the public in 1980, restricting the venue to invitation-only for special occasions.\n\nIt was announced on Wednesday that the BT Group had sold the tower for £275m to MCR Hotels, and now architectural heritage campaign group C20 says it hopes to see the revolving restaurant reinstated.\n\nIn 2002, former postmaster general Tony Benn explored the restaurant he had visited on many previous occasions.\n\nFrom: Afoot again in the past, 2002",

They need to apologise to my 10-year-old, they took his mum away on his birthday.\n\n“I was eight weeks pregnant - they need to apologise to my youngest son. It was terrible. I haven't accepted the apologies,' she added.\n\nDavid Smith told the inquiry this morning that in hindsight his email about Misra's case was 'poorly thought through'.\n\n'Brilliant news. Well done. Please pass on my thanks to the team,' Smith said in a 2010 email to colleagues.\n\nMisra was handed a 15-month jail term while being eight weeks pregnant.\n\nShe had been wrongly accused of stealing £70,000 from her Post Office branch in the village of West Byfleet in Surrey and was sent to Bronzefield prison on the day of her eldest son's 10th birthday.",

The 41-year-old former Wales international was three times over the limit when he was arrested in Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, on 7 July. Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday the former scrum half - who gave the court his full name as William Mike Phillips - was in an Audi A4 when the offence happened. The court was told 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath was recorded in a reading. The legal limit is 35.\n\nThe ban will be cut by 25 weeks, if Phillips, who also represented the British and Irish Lions, finishes an awareness course by 8 January 2026. Phillips was also fined £1,153 and ordered to pay £461 surcharge and £85 costs.",

There was even more urban diplomacy on show from another woman, who said 'even if we've got only one trophy this year, I'm not bothered - at least we've won a trophy'. 'Well done to Manchester United - they deserve a win after all the years they've had,' she added.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong.

I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.\n\nThe force said Ronchi 'demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of other road users when he sped through a built-up residential area in such a reckless manner'.",

The small ceramic animal, which had been treasured for 55 years by Canadian Raymond Patten, was auctioned in Staffordshire on Tuesday. It was given to him on his 21st birthday by a great aunt who worked as a cook at Cambridge University. 'I believe she knew the future King on a personal basis. I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.' Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance. 'He is in his retirement years and wanted to find it a new home where it would be treasured for decades to come.'

They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",
