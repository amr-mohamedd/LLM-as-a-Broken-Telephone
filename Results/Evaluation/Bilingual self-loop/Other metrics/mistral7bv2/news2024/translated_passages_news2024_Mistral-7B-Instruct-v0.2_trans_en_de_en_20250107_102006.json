Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

            "text": "It was another busy morning on this week's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. We're closing our coverage now, but before we go here's a recap from today's show.\n\nWe heard from Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who acknowledged that families have been let down over decades by the infected blood scandal, though he wouldn't be drawn on the amount of compensation due.\n\nOn Ukraine he said the west 'took its eye off the ball' and he doesn't want a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nShadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting outlined plans to cut NHS waiting lists and said a future Labour government would ensure victims of the infected blood scandal are compensated.\n\nWe also had an interview with Leonid Volkov, former aide to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is 'bluffing'.\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

            "text": "We expected a fiery day on Paula Vennells' last day at the inquiry, and that's what we got.\n\nThe former Post Office CEO faced questions from a several lawyers representing sub-postmasters, who did not hold back.\n\n'You preach compassion but don't practice it,' one said right at the beginning.\n\nThe room was jam packed - I saw a couple of people actually looking for spare seats in the chamber. There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.\n\nOne sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.\n\nThe most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was 'bored' listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'lacked passion'.\n\nBy then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.\n\nThank you for joining us today.

On board was then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThousands turned out to watch her plane touch down at Taipei’s old Songshan airport. The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent. Only later did it admit that for the first time ever China had fired ballistic missiles over the top of the island, into the Pacific Ocean.",

Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station. 'Stoppages are perfectly normal and commonly experienced in theme parks everywhere.”\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and on X, external.

A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries.

The focus on the upcoming match against Fulham, the team's confidence, and the presence of experienced Premier League players are all expressed in the English version.

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

The small ceramic animal, which had been treasured for 55 years by Canadian Raymond Patten, was auctioned in Staffordshire on Tuesday. It was given to him on his 21st birthday by a great aunt who worked as a cook at Cambridge University. 'I believe she knew the future King on a personal basis. I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.' Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance. 'He is in his retirement years and wanted to find it a new home where it would be treasured for decades to come.'
