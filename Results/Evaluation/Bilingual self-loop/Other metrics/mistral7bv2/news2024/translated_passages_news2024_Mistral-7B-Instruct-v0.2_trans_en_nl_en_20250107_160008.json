We're now wrapping up our live coverage.\n\nHis brief testimony lasted just four minutes, which took us all a bit by surprise here in the newsroom.\n\nThe short time on the stand was because Judge Lewis Kaplan had given Trump a very limited scope of what he could talk about. A separate trial last year found Trump sexually assaulted Carroll, so it meant he couldn't repeat his denials and had to stick to what was relevant in the case.\n\nCourt returns tomorrow for closing arguments and the jury to be sent off for deliberations.

The Palace is 'nothing if not excellent at preparation', he said. 'So whilst this is an unwelcome surprise, I don't think that it will require a significant new change to some of these structures that are in place.' Payne, who worked for the King and Camilla for five years until 2021, also told the BBC's Newshour programme he's sure the King will be keen to return to his public engagements once and if it is deemed prudent. 'He will be deeply frustrated that he can't go out and meet people. 'He really, really enjoys that. He comes back absolutely fired up from all of the conversations.'",

            "text": "Hyperia was closed the day after it first opened in May\n\nThe UK’s tallest rollercoaster has reopened after another breakdown halted rides. Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station. 'Stoppages are perfectly normal and commonly experienced in theme parks everywhere.”\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and on X, external.

            "text": "Rene, 31, suffered severe injuries and could not be saved\n\nA chimpanzee has died at Edinburgh Zoo after it was severely injured in a troop fight. Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

And both leading candidates have been put on notice about what may lie ahead if they become first minister.",

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.\n\nThe force said Ronchi 'demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of other road users when he sped through a built-up residential area in such a reckless manner'.",

I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.' Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance.

        "0": {
            "text": "For now, there’s a sigh of relief, a pause.\n\nIsrael’s limited strike, not officially acknowledged, has given space to Tehran. In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",
