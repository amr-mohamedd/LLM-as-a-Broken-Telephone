But the thorough nature of an inquiry like this ensures it can still shock.\n\nTake a four-minute exchange at just after 11 this morning. The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses.

He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is 'bluffing'.\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.\n\nOne sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.\n\nThe most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was 'bored' listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'lacked passion'.\n\nBy then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.\n\nThank you for joining us today.

China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent.

Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station. 'Stoppages are perfectly normal and commonly experienced in theme parks everywhere.”\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and on X, external.

Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.\n\nThe force said Ronchi 'demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of other road users when he sped through a built-up residential area in such a reckless manner'.",

            "text": "A video released by the Philippine military appears to show Chinese and Filipino boats clashing in the contested waters of the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines has accused Chinese vessels of ramming Philippine boats, then boarding them and seizing weapons.\n\nThe country's top military commander General Romeo Brawner said Chinese coast guard personnel were armed with swords, spears and knives.\n\nThis appears to be an escalation, after a series of dangerous encounters, as the two sides seek to enforce their claims on disputed reefs and outcrops.\n\nThe confrontation took place as the Philippine navy and coast guard were delivering supplies to Filipino troops stationed in the Second Thomas Shoal, a decrepit navy ship used as a Filipino outpost.\n\nBeijing said its personnel were professional and restrained, adding that they were aiming to block an 'illegal transportation' of supplies.\n\nRead more on this story here.",

I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.' Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance.

They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",
