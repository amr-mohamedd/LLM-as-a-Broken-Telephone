The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

            "text": "On 2 August 2022 Taiwan television channels began live tracking a US government jet heading north across the South China Sea on course for Taiwan. On board was then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThousands turned out to watch her plane touch down at Taipei’s old Songshan airport. The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent. Only later did it admit that for the first time ever China had fired ballistic missiles over the top of the island, into the Pacific Ocean.",

            "text": "Hyperia was closed the day after it first opened in May\n\nThe UK’s tallest rollercoaster has reopened after another breakdown halted rides. Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station. 'Stoppages are perfectly normal and commonly experienced in theme parks everywhere.”\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and on X, external.

Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

The 41-year-old former Wales international was three times over the limit when he was arrested in Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, on 7 July. Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday the former scrum half - who gave the court his full name as William Mike Phillips - was in an Audi A4 when the offence happened. The court was told 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath was recorded in a reading. The legal limit is 35.\n\nThe ban will be cut by 25 weeks, if Phillips, who also represented the British and Irish Lions, finishes an awareness course by 8 January 2026. Phillips was also fined £1,153 and ordered to pay £461 surcharge and £85 costs.",

At Llandrindod Wells, Phillips, who presented himself as William Mike Phillips during the offense and was driving an Audi A4, testified. The court learned that 108 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of breath were recorded on the device. The legal limit is 35.\n\nPhillips' driving ban will be reduced by 25 weeks if, as a British and Irish Lions representative and former player, he completes an awareness course before January 8, 2026. Phillips was sentenced to a total fine of 2,504 £ in penalties, 461 £ in court costs, and 85 £ in additional court fees.",

            "text": "A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting her twice in 1975 when she was 17.\n\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nMs Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.\n\nThe judge decided the case did not qualify for a two-year window for submitting claims that would otherwise fall outside the usual legal time limit, because Tyler's alleged conduct did not meet the criteria for posing a 'serious risk of physical injury'.\n\nTyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: 'We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.'\n\nThe singer has also denied claims in a separate continuing case filed by another woman in 2022.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

The 36-year-old American earned a unanimous decision against Madrimov, extending his streak of consecutive victories to 41. Crawford, a former world champion at lightweight and undisputed champion at super-lightweight and super-welterweight, dominated Madrimov with scores of 116-112, 115-113, and 115-113. Madrimov, 29, suffered his first professional defeat in his 12th fight.\n\n'He was a formidable opponent,' Crawford stated. 'He's really strong. He's robust. He took solid punches. He took me to the 12th round. He had quick hands, a good rhythm. He was very disciplined and fought well. I stayed standing. I didn't want to rush things. That's why I took some punches - I took them at the beginning.'\n\nIf the price was right, we should have faced each other, added Crawford.",

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

Michael Howard of Reform UK came in third place with 6,773 votes.\n\nThis was a significant reversal compared to his crushing victory in the February partial elections, where he gained over 6,000 votes by capitalizing on Labour's stance on the Gaza conflict.

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.\n\nThe force said Ronchi 'demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of other road users when he sped through a built-up residential area in such a reckless manner'.",
