Un acteur en armure monte sur scène et nous accueille à Troy, où les Grecs et les Trojiens se battent depuis...environ 7 ans sur les champs de bataille trojiens. Le Prologue nous met rapidement au courant. En un mot, pour ceux d'entre nous qui ne savent rien, voici ce qui se passe : Les Grecs ont traversé la 'baie d'Athéna' pour piller Troy parce qu'un prince trojan nommé Paris a volé Hélène, reine des Grecs, à Menelaus, roi des Grecs, et vit avec elle depuis. Rien de plus complexe à cela. Le Prologue nous avertit ensuite que nous pourrions ne pas apprécier la pièce car rien de bien ne se produit durant 'les guerres'. De plus, le Prologue ne dit rien du tout des personnages Troilus et Cressida, auxquels Shakespeare a donné le nom à la pièce.

He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making. However, Hamilton responds that this would introduce unnecessary delays and inefficiencies to the process and weaken the American negotiating position.",

Passepartout listens at first but leaves when he finds it tedious. Suddenly, at Ogden, the train comes to an abrupt halt, and another Mormon appears quickly, having had a dispute at home. Passepartout asks this man how many wives he has, and he replies that he has only one. Passepartout finds this strange among other Mormons and perhaps more intriguing, as having multiple wives is a controversial aspect of their history, known as polygamy. However, it's important to note that the practice was officially discontinued by the church in 1890, and the church now advocates monogamy.",

I would swell with pride and blush with shame.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\nThe Inhabitant of the Cave came to me, admitting that my laziness was the only thing that fit me perfectly. It was enough for me. If someone had asked me what I was, my answer would have been clear: a beggar! For instance: The liveliness of the Cave had diminished Lafitte's talents, and that was my only true value, at least I thought so. Thus, a man can live happily. However, The Inhabitant of the Cave did not have this calling. If I could choose what I was, I would choose...mmm...a gourmet. A gourmet capable of savoring 'all that is beautiful and sublime'. The more I told myself that, the more I understood that I should be the author of my own life: to savor the beautiful and the sublime. I realized that this life would make me shed endless tears. Every time someone did something beautiful and sublime, I would shed tears of joy. I would swell with pride and blush with shame.",

Coriolanus proceeds to insult the tribunes and plebeians, daring them to punish him with exile, death, or torture. Meanwhile, his senator buddies can only stand by and watch this train wreck unfold. Finally, the tribunes declare that Coriolanus is banned from Rome 4EVA. Coriolanus is all 'Oh yeah? I don't think so. You're not banishing me. I'm banishing you!'",

She establishes a routine in their new home, and she keeps herself hopeful by setting aside a chair or books for her husband and otherwise behaving as if he lived there, too. Her father informs her that there is a place that she can stand on the sidewalk during certain hours which is overlooked by a window in the prison which her husband may sometimes look out. Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks. He notices that she is there every day, and he mocks her for knowing someone in the prison, pretending to guillotine the whole family with his saw. During December, a crowd of five hundred including Jacques Four and the Vengeance descend on Lucie while she is walking near the prison. She is frightened, but her father reassures her that they will not harm her. Madame Defarge walks by and salutes them. Charles is summoned to appear in court the next day",

The apparition only signals for Hamlet to follow it elsewhere. Horatio and Marcellus plead with Hamlet not to obey the ghost, fearing it could be dangerous and even lead to his death; but Hamlet ignores their warnings, breaks free of their grasp when they try to physically restrain him, and follows the Ghost. Horatio and Marcellus are convinced that 'there is something strange in Denmark,' and decide to follow as well.",

However, his suspicion and tolerant attitude do not make a good impression on Lydgate.\n\nTranslation:\n\nLydgate était indifférent au vote sur la question du chapelainat à l'hôpital. Ayant rencontré Farebrother et été attiré par lui, il se trouve dans un dilemme. Personnellement, Lydgate préfère Farebrother, qui a une touche humaine et a occupé cette fonction depuis le début sans rémunération. Maintenant que la position est rémunérée, il semble injuste de le refuser. Cependant, Bulstrode est le principal appui de Lydgate dans la ville, où il prévoit une opposition sérieuse à ses plans de réformes médicales. Ainsi, Lydgate assiste à la réunion dans un état confus. Les discussions parmi les membres réunis avaient été chaudes et personnelles auparavant. Quand Lydgate arrive en dernière, il les trouve toujours divisées. Finalement, son vote décisif est déterminé par son égo brûlant. M",

Before leaving, the sisters had arrived in a calash. They informed her that Frank Churchill would be coming the next day and would stay for two weeks, and they promised to take her back to Hartfield.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Weston and Frank appeared to Emma at Woodhouse. Emma thought Frank was elegant, quick, and agile. Mrs. Weston's charm and politeness were complemented by Frank's. Emma felt drawn to Frank and believed, as she often did, that he had feelings for her. However, she knew that Jane Fairfax had already discovered this.\n\n(Note: In English, 'calash' can be translated as 'calasche' or 'fiacre,' both being traditional horse-drawn carriages.)",

Tom used to be the stable boy at the Whites' house, but because he is rather dreamy and irresponsible, he lost that position. Now, he does odd jobs and is quite happy. His grandmother comes regularly to clean his rented rooms, and he has a rather oddly disciplined approach to life experiences. He wants to do things, but he chooses specific experiences and then goes out and intentionally lives them. For example, having fallen in love with Helen White, he limits what he allows himself to think about her. One night, he decides he ought to try drinking to see what it feels like. He buys a bottle of whiskey and walks about a mile north of town, where he sits on a bank of grass and gets drunk. In his drunkenness, he goes and talks to George Willard about Helen. George is upset at first, but then they cement a bond between them. Tom decides that, now that he has been drunk, he will not need to try it again.",

Elizabeth partly shared Charlotte's opinion, acknowledging that she could have forgiven Darcy's pride if it weren't for the insult he had directed at her. Mary pondered the difference between pride and vanity. This chapter also includes a brief description of the Lucas family - Sir William Lucas was formerly a merchant and had been knighted as mayor. He is pleasant and courteous. Lady Lucas is a loving and lazy woman. They have several children, Charlotte being the eldest, sensible, intelligent and practical.",

Les premiers jours avaient été calmes, mais plus tard, le navire a été pris dans une tempête, perdant ainsi du temps précieux. Naviguant à plein régime, la réserve de charbon s'était rapidement vide comme carburant. Cependant, Fogg avait ordonné à l'ingénieur de maintenir plein régime.

In the context of the passage, it is clear that it refers to 'her will' based on the subsequent actions. However, in English, it is more common to speak of 'his will' or 'her will' to refer to a person's last wishes, rather than 'her chest'. Therefore, in the English translation, I have remained faithful to the original meaning and context by using 'her will' for clarity and 'her chest' for the original expression.",

He returns to the shore to get his piece of wood, planning to try and float across, but the yard has floated back out to sea. David is now miserable. He begins eating raw shellfish. Sometimes he manages to keep them down, and other times they make him extremely sick. He is especially depressed because he can see a church and several houses on the mainland, but he knows he cannot cross the river. The next day he sees, to his surprise, a red deer, which he realizes must have swum the river. He also discovers that he has lost all his money after the shipwreck. He sees some fisherman, and wildly hails them from the shore. But, to his shock, they only point and laugh at him. The fishermen return later and, in broken English, reveal to him that the river gets very low at low tide.

Featherstone, perdue dans ses pensées sur les événements du jour sans les partager. Elle sentait que ses désirs étaient inutiles. Soudain, M. Featherstone a demandé à elle d'ouvrir la boîte contenant son testament et de le détruire; Mary s'est refusée, même quand il a offert une somme considérable d'argent pour cette tâche. Mary avait des inquiétudes quant à la récente vitalité et aux comportements étranges de M. Featherstone. M. Featherstone est tombé endormi, et le lendemain, il était mort.\n\nTranslation:\n\nMary Garth spent the night at M. Featherstone's, lost in thought about the day's events without sharing them. She felt her desires were pointless. Suddenly, M. Featherstone asked her to open the box containing his will and destroy one of them; Mary refused, even when he offered a considerable amount of money for this task. Mary had concerns about M. Featherstone's recent vitality and odd behaviors. M. Featherstone fell asleep, and the next day, he was dead.",

Pendant la visite de Nelly, Heathcliff insulte et déshonore Isabella, se vante de sa cruauté. Il avoue même avoir tué son chien compagnon avant leur elopement. Heathcliff demande à Nelly de faciliter une rencontre entre Catherine et lui-même. Nelly répond que tel une rencontre serait certainement dangereuse pour sa maîtresse. Heathcliff menace Nelly, disant qu'il la gardera à Wuthering Heights et ira lui-même au Manoir. Craintant les conséquences de cette action si drastique, Nelly cède et accepte de porter la lettre de Heathcliff à Catherine et de préparer une rencontre entre eux si sa maîtresse le consent. À",

Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",

It explores the concept of concurrent and exclusive powers in taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both states and the federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the state or the federal government can exercise. In taxation, the federal government's ability to levy taxes does not supersede that of the state governments, as taxation is a concurrent power. The only limitation on the states' power to levy taxes is related to duties on imports and exports. Congress can impose such duties, but state governments can only do so with Congress's consent.

Il aborde la notion de pouvoirs partagés et exclusifs dans les affaires fiscales. Les pouvoirs partagés sont ceux que détiennent à la fois les États et le gouvernement fédéral. Les pouvoirs exclusifs sont ceux qui peuvent être exercés uniquement par une seule partie, soit un État soit le gouvernement fédéral. En matière de taxes, la capacité du gouvernement fédéral à percevoir des taxes ne remplace pas celle des États, car l'imposition de taxes est un pouvoir partagé. Cependant, le pouvoir d'administration d'un État pour imposer des droits de douane sur les importations et les exportations est lié à cela. Le Congrès peut imposer des droits de douane, mais les États peuvent le faire seulement avec l'approbation du Congrès. Hamilton reconnaît que le pouvoir partagé d'imposition des taxes entre les États et le gouvernement fédéral peut conduire à des situations où les deux parties imposent des taxes sur la même chose, ce qui peut être 'inexpedient'.",
