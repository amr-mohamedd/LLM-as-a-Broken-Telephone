He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making. However, Hamilton responds that this would introduce unnecessary delays and inefficiencies to the process and weaken the American negotiating position.",

He responded to the criticism that the Constitution confused legal and administrative power in the convention process, as both branches can participate in the convention and approval. Hanilon argued that the convention-making process is not suitable for the usual administrative or legal branches. Therefore, the appropriate role allocation is necessary. Some people believe that the power to make treaties should be limited to the presidency. Hanilon countered, unlike European monarchies, the president's term is limited. He might sign harmful treaties for the national interest but beneficial for his personal interest, but eventually, he would become an ordinary citizen. Therefore, the power to check him lies with the legislative branch. However, some argue that the legislative branch should have more treaty-making power.

He informs Sue, who arrives for the funeral. After the funeral, Sue and Jude have a discussion about Aunt Drusilla's disapproval of marriage for the Fawleys. Sue confesses to an intense physical aversion to Phillotson, although she respects and likes him as a friend. Jude senses her unhappiness and laments the fact that he did not try to prevent her hasty marriage. Sue will not let Jude comfort her and goes off to Widow Edlin's cottage for the night. Later that night, Jude hears the cry of trapped rabbit, and, unable to bear it, he goes out and relieves it of further pain by putting it to death. He finds Sue awake at her window, and she breaks down and pours out all her suffering to him. She finally admits her mistake in not considering the full implications of marriage.",

Known throughout the village as 'the young squire,' he is a dashing man who is staying at the Squire's estate to recover from an injury in the army.

It is a time when many people think they live in the best of times, while others condemn it as the worst of times. The kings of England and France are both mediocre rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People are put to death for the slightest of crimes. The condition in France is very bad, for there is a total disregard for the common people by the aristocracy; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are rampant. The aristocracy is unaware that the masses are preparing for the revolution by turning timber into guillotines and farm carts into tumbrels to convey people to the guillotine. In England, too, lawlessness and poverty prevail. Even the colonies in America are up in arms against their English rulers, and the attempts of the American colonies to obtain freedom are not taken seriously.",

            "text": "Fifteen years ago, this novel painted a picture of the ancient French setting. Some saw it as an age of affluence, while others unveiled its concealed allure and enchantment. The English monarchy held onto power through inheritance, pardons for sins, and the pardon of criminals; the French nobility averted their gaze from the toil and hardships of peasants, while the common people suffered under unjust laws and widespread poverty. The French nobility ignited a revolution, transforming battlefields into battlefields and revolution squares into slaughterhouses; the English masses remained composed, witnessing the chaos and destitution from a distance. The American colonies fostered anti-English resistance, but their longing for freedom was disregarded.",

She continues to blame her husband for her unhappiness, not her rabid materialism; everything is someone else's fault, and she is still a creature who is perfectly innocent of blame. She gets a letter from Will, saying that he will be paying a visit sometime soon; Rosamond is cheered up by this, and decides to send out invitations for a dinner party. Of course, all invitations are denied, and Rosamond is still ignorant as to the reason why; she goes to visit her parents, and they tell her the terrible news. When she goes home, she tells her husband that she has heard about everything; she then reiterates that they must go to London, to lessen her suffering. He cannot stand to hear this, and storms out, without taking the time to correct her or explain anything.",

Jane continues to pay attention to the relationship between St. John and Rosamond, who often visits the school when she knows St. John will be there. Rosamond asks Jane to draw her portrait, and as she is working on it one day, St. John pays her a visit. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. She offers to draw him a duplicate, and then boldly declares that he ought to marry Rosamond. St. John admits that he loves her and is tempted by her beauty, but he explains that he refuses to allow worldly affection to interfere with his holy duties. The flirtatious, silly, and shallow Rosamond would make a terrible wife for a missionary. Suddenly, St. John notices something on the edge of Jane's paper and tears off a tiny piece--Jane is not certain why. With a peculiar look on his face, he hurries from the room",

He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain.

Her father informs her that there is a place that she can stand on the sidewalk during certain hours which is overlooked by a window in the prison which her husband may sometimes look out. Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks. He notices that she is there every day, and he mocks her for knowing someone in the prison, pretending to guillotine the whole family with his saw. During December, a crowd of five hundred including Jacques Four and the Vengeance descend on Lucie while she is walking near the prison. She is frightened, but her father reassures her that they will not harm her. Madame Defarge walks by and salutes them. Charles is summoned to appear in court the next day",

Hanli trembled and swallowed hard, 'This is the New King, an old custom of my uncle and father, drinking.' Suddenly, a ghostly figure appeared. Hanli bowed respectfully to the figure, addressing it as 'Magnificent King of Danping City.' The ghost merely pointed the way. Huoolas and Masaris sighed in relief, worried that Hanli might heed the ghost's summons and be endangered, even risking his life. But Hanli ignored their warnings. When they tried to stop him, he continued forward, following the ghost. Huoolas and Masaris thought 'There are corrupt elements in the Danping Country,' and decided to follow Hanli.",

Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life.

She thought it was better for him to continue believing that things had always been wrong between them, even though he was not actually at fault. Isabel continued to ponder until four in the afternoon. She couldn't shake off the shocking image of Madame Raven and Omand together.\n\n(Isabel mulled over deeply. We have come to understand her thoughts towards her marriage with Omand and London Rod's infatuation with Pansy. Isabel questioned herself in her heart, did she give Omand a false self-image during their initial encounter? Isabel supposed that Omand disliked her due to her lack of traditional sensibilities. However, was it her uniqueness that drew people to her, or was it merely his disdain for her views and beliefs, coupled with his rage towards her overall lifestyle? We uncovered the background of their relationship: Omand had acquired complete dominance over Isabel, who had once been so confident and self-reliant. Isabel and Omand had not communicated with each other for a long time. Isabel was aware of Omand's anger and apprehension, as Ralph had resided in Rome for an extended period.

Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle.

Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day.

How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on. Gulliver is granted limited freedom on certain conditions. In return for abiding by the conditions, he will receive food sufficient for 1,728 Lilliputians.

Cedric does not want to entertain these Normans, but his Saxon pride demands that they be offered hospitality; however, he clings to his dignity by refusing to go out to welcome them.

He does not trust the Knight Templar and does not want anything to interfere with his plans to marry Rowena off to the right gentleman.

The next day Mr. Weston and Frank call at Woodhouse. Emma finds Frank to be a very good-looking gentleman of well-bred manners; she is also impressed by his lively spirit. He praises Mrs. Weston for her pretty looks and elegant manners. Emma immediately likes Frank and imaginatively concludes that Frank also has an interest in her. She barely notices that he plans to call on Jane Fairfax next since he already knows her.",

A crowd of somber, dreary-looking people has gathered outside the door of a prison in seventeenth-century Boston. The building's heavy oak door is studded with iron spikes, and the prison appears to have been constructed to hold dangerous criminals. No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately. This is true of the citizens of Boston, who built their prison some twenty years earlier. The one incongruity in the otherwise drab scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door. The narrator suggests that it offers a reminder of Nature's kindness to the condemned; for his tale, he says, it will provide either a 'sweet moral blossom' or else some relief in the face of unrelenting sorrow and gloom",

A light breakfast is enjoyed and then pipes are smoked. After breakfast, people tend to whatever they like. Tinor inspects her cloth and food supplies; Marheyo works on his hut; the girls adorn their hair and skin with oils. The narrator usually wanders with Kory-Kory or else sits inside. Then they enjoy a midday nap. Usually in the afternoon, the narrator goes to the Ti, where Mehevi and the other chiefs gather. Since women are not allowed in the Ti, it resembles a happy bachelor pad where the best food can be found and where the men sit around smoking and talking. After night falls, a light evening meal of 'poee-poee,' cooked breadfruit, is eaten. Native girls often dance around their huts under the moonlight. Everyone then sleeps. In general, life with the Typees resembles a continual gentle slumber, with activities in between",

One day, she runs into Hareton, who tries to impress her with the fact that he can now read his own name above the door. She just mocks him and goes into the house. Hareton bursts in and throws a screaming Linton into the kitchen. Linton later blames Cathy for the scene, but they make up. And that's the end of Cathy's narration. Nelly promptly tells Edgar about Cathy's visits to the Heights; again, she is forbidden to go there.",

Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'. Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's pride if he had not affronted hers. Mary philosophically muses about the distinction between 'pride' and 'vanity'. The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas was a tradesman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, the eldest of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical girl.",

Shortly after this conversation with Sir Claude, Maisie hears from Mrs. Wix that he has been secretly seeing Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix is convinced of this.

Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts.

He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was.

Now the author addresses the widowed queen, telling her to be strong and endure in the memory of the light they two shared. He ends by saying something along the lines of, 'May Albert's love, the love of her children, and the love of her people surround her until God's love reunites her with her husband again.'",

He returns to the shore to get his piece of wood, planning to try and float across, but the yard has floated back out to sea. David is now miserable. He begins eating raw shellfish. Sometimes he manages to keep them down, and other times they make him extremely sick. He is especially depressed because he can see a church and several houses on the mainland, but he knows he cannot cross the river. The next day he sees, to his surprise, a red deer, which he realizes must have swum the river. He also discovers that he has lost all his money after the shipwreck. He sees some fisherman, and wildly hails them from the shore. But, to his shock, they only point and laugh at him. The fishermen return later and, in broken English, reveal to him that the river gets very low at low tide.

Cyrano proposes that he join his eloquence to Christian's good looks to create the perfect lover for Roxane. He will write some eloquent speeches for Christian to deliver to Roxane as his own. Cyrano claims that he only wants to do this to practise his literary skills. From his pocket, he produces the letter he wrote earlier to Roxane and hands it to Christian to give to her. Christian embraces Cyrano in gratitude. The other Guards, Lise, and the Musketeer enter and are astonished to see Cyrano embracing Christian. The Musketeer believes that Cyrano must have undergone a transformation that means it is safe to talk about his nose. He impudently stares at Cyrano's nose, asking what the smell could be. Cyrano cries, 'It's pigshit. and floors the Musketeer with a blow.",

Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",
