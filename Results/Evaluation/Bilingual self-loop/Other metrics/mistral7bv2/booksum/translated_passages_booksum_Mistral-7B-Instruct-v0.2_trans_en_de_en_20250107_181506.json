Falstaff orders Bardolph to fill his bag and call for Peto to meet him at the city limit. He dislikes leading his men through the city in their tattered clothing. None of them were able to bribe him, as others had, to be excused from military duty. In Falstaff's words: 'No eye has ever seen such old dogs and cats.' Prince Hal and Westmoreland encounter him on the road and notice the wretched beings he is leading. The knight remains unimpressed and reacts philosophically to this criticism.

Scrooge continues to walk through the city and happily talks with everyone he meets. He visits Fred's house and has a wonderful time at the party. The next morning, Scrooge gets to work early.

Ermengarde fragt den Grund und Sara gesteht, dass sie Schmerzen hat, weil sie ihren Vater vermissen. Dann fragt Ermengarde Sara, ob sie Freunde werden können. Das ist ganz normal. Sara stimmt zu. Juhu, BFF!\n\nEnglish Translation:\nSara might be a rather peculiar child, but Ermengarde St. John has an unusually peculiar name. She, fortunately, is not maternal towards Ermengarde, which draws Sara to her. After classes, Sara introduces herself. Ermengarde infers that Sara must be intelligent because she speaks French. Sara behaves like every child when making friends – she asks Ermengarde if she can introduce Emily, her doll, to her. When she tells fantastic stories about Emily, Ermengarde is impressed by her imagination. Suddenly, Sara seems to be in pain. Ermengarde asks the reason and Sara admits that she is in pain because she misses her father. Then Ermengarde asks Sara if they can be friends. That's quite normal. Sara agrees. Yay, BFF!",

Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. Arrangements are made to provide for the Micawbers' debts and raise enough money to get them to Australia. Two days later, Miss Betsey takes David to a hospital and to a funeral. She tells him that her husband has died, and that he will not be a threat to her anymore",

An actor dressed in armor comes out on stage and welcomes us to ancient Troy, where the Greeks and Trojans have been going at it on the Trojan battlefields for the last...get this...7 years. Since we're starting out 'in the middle' of all the action, the Prologue quickly catches us up to speed. You know, just in case we've never heard of a little old thing called the Trojan War. Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since. Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.' By the way, Shmooperinos, the Prologue says absolutely NOTHING about Troilus and Cressida, the two characters Shakespeare named this play after. What's up with that?",

Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making.

Mr. Irwine is a bachelor because he has chosen to take care of his mother and two unmarried sisters, one of whom is chronically ill, rather than have his own family. Joshua Rann, the cobbler and parish clerk of Hayslope, comes to see Mr. Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah. In particular, Mr. Rann complains about the wheelwright, Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made disparaging remarks about Mr. Irwine and Rann. Mr. Irwine laughs off the insults and tells Rann to leave Maskery to his own business. As Rann is leaving, Captain Arthur Donnithorne arrives to ask Mr. Irwine to go riding with him. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landlord, Squire Donnithorne. Known throughout the village as 'the young squire,' he is a dashing man who is staying at the Squire's estate to recover from an injury in the army. Rann tells both Mr. Irwine and Captain Donnithorne about the death of Thias Bede, Adam's father",

Gaspard, who murdered the Marquis for running down his child, went into hiding for nearly a year after the killing. The French authorities recently captured, jailed, and hanged him, and left his corpse dangling by the village fountain, with his shadow poisoning the atmosphere of the town. Monsieur and Madame Defarge later take the road-mender to Versailles, where the splendor of the court dazzles him. Caught up in the emotion of the experience, the road-mender cheers the King, Queen, and other nobles. The Defarges commend his behavior, feeling that it will fuel the courtiers' arrogance and ignorance of the revolutionary movement. Additionally, the Defarges believe that the sight of such luxury and finery will supply the road-mender with a focus for his hatred and violence in the future.",

The kings of England and France are both mediocre rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People are put to death for the slightest of crimes. The condition in France is very bad, for there is a total disregard for the common people by the aristocracy; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are rampant. The aristocracy is unaware that the masses are preparing for the revolution by turning timber into guillotines and farm carts into tumbrels to convey people to the guillotine.

The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him.

Während sie sprechen, hören sie fern Geräusche von Trompetenblasen und Kanonenschüssen. Hamlet pfeift auf sein Horn und erklärt, dass dies ein Zeichen ist, dass sein Onkel und Stiefvater, der neue König, an seinem schmutzigen Trinkgelage teilnimmt. Plötzlich erscheint der Geist. Hamlet spricht verächtlich zu dem Apparat: 'König, Vater; königliches Dänemark,' und fragt, warum es in der Nacht herumstreifet. Der Geist zeigt nur an, dass Hamlet folgen solle. Horatio und Marcellus raten Hamlet, dem Geist nicht nachzufolgen, fürchtet, es könnte gefährlich und ihn töten; aber Hamlet ignoriert die Warnungen seiner Freunde, bricht los, wenn sie ihn zurückhalten wollen, und folgt dem Geist. Horatio und Marcellus sind überzeugt, dass 'etwas verdächtigs in Dänemark",

Although Mr. Bumble is worried, Mrs. Bumble stays calm and negotiates with the monkeys. They reach a deal of fifty-two pounds for their expertise. Mrs. Bumble recounts how they were cheated by Old Sally Oliver. She discloses that in Old Sally's dead hands, they found a recipe for hypocrisy, which they had exchanged for the golden jewelry box they had received. Inside it, they found wedding rings and two hairpins. One ring bears the inscription 'Agnes,' followed by a blank space for the family name. The monkeys secure the jewelry box to a weight and throw it into the river water.",

Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death . A fellow playwright, Thomas Middleton, may have written the snazzy songs in this scene.",

Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle. The Mock Turtle, sitting on a little rocky ledge, is sad and constantly sighing. Alice requests the Mock Turtle to tell her, his history. The Mock Turtle very proudly lists the various subjects that were taught to him. The subjects include, Reeling and Writhing and the different branches of Arithmetic . Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day. The Mock turtle asserts that it is 'because of this that they are called lessons'.",

The diversions, however, prove to be quite different than one might expect. It is the Lilliputian court custom that men seeking political office demonstrate their agility in rope dancing, among other things. How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on. Gulliver is granted limited freedom on certain conditions. In return for abiding by the conditions, he will receive food sufficient for 1,728 Lilliputians.

From out of the great mists, a messenger on horseback appears and asks to speak to Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank. The travelers react warily, fearing that they have come upon a highwayman or robber. Mr. Lorry, however, recognizes the messenger's voice as that of Jerry Cruncher, the odd-job man at Tellson's, and accepts his message. The note that Jerry passes him reads: 'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle. Lorry instructs Jerry to return to Tellson's with this reply: 'Recalled to Life.

It is located by Temple Bar, the spot where, until recently, the government displayed the heads of executed criminals. The narrator explains that at this time, 'death was a recipe much in vogue,' used against all manner of criminals, from forgers to horse thieves to counterfeiters. Jerry Cruncher, employed by Tellson's as a runner and messenger, wakes up in his small apartment, located in an unsavory London neighborhood. He begins the day by yelling at his wife for 'praying against' him; he throws his muddy boot at her. Around nine o'clock, Cruncher and his young son camp outside Tellson's Bank, where they await the bankers' instructions. When an indoor messenger calls for a porter, Cruncher takes off to do the job. As young Jerry sits alone, he wonders why his father's fingers always have rust on them",

Nelly informierte Edgar erneut, dass Cathy nicht mehr auf dem Hügel kommen durfe.\n\n(Note: In this translation, I have preserved the original meaning and context while translating the passage from German to English.

The doctor asks about Heathcliff and informs her of their planned meeting the day before. This bothers Ellen, and upon entering Isabella's room, she finds it empty. They conclude that Catherine is seeking peace and having her wishes granted. Later, a maid emerges and explains the circumstances. She reveals that Isabella and Heathcliff have run away. The maid explains that they spent the night together. Linton calms her down by informing her that no one is looking for them, as Isabella had voluntarily departed. He asks her not to mention Isabella anymore and sets her former concerns aside.",

Ivanhoe tells Richard that his kingdom is in disarray and he should act quickly to reclaim it. Richard replies that he needs to wait until he is sure that the various forces he is depending on are marshaled and ready. Robin Hood also fears that Richard should not stay in the forest too long. He sets up a ruse whereby it appears they are under attack by Normans. This brings the banquet to a sudden end. Then Robin confesses the ruse to Richard, and Richard realizes that it is indeed time for him to move on. He sets off with Ivanhoe, Gurth and Wamba for Athelstane's castle, which is in mourning for its lost leader",

Also since the ship had been traveling on full steam the vessel runs out of coal, as fuel. Fogg nevertheless asks the engineer to run the ship on full steam. He then summons Speedy and pays him enough money to be allowed to burn parts of the ship, in order to use them as fuel.

Shortly after this conversation with Sir Claude, Maisie hears from Mrs. Wix that he has been secretly seeing Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix is convinced of this. Maisie has a hard time accepting that Sir Claude would have lied to her. But soon enough, she gets proof that he has been seeing Mrs. Beale when he takes her to her father's house to see her. Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts. Maisie realizes that this means she won't get to see Mrs. Wix or say goodbye--but only after it's too late.",

He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was.

(German)\n\nExplanation:\nThe original German sentence 'Before er es wieder aufgenommen und entdeckt hatte es in seinem Leben gewachsen' can be translated into English as 'Before he had resumed it and discovered it, it had grown in his life.' The word 'it' in this context refers to a situation or circumstance that had developed in the person's life before they resumed their search and made the discovery.\n\nTo preserve the original meaning and context, the German sentence structure must be maintained. The German sentence is in the past perfect tense, which requires the auxiliary verb 'haben' (to have) followed by the past participle of the main verb 'gewachsen' (grown). In English, we can use the past perfect tense with the auxiliary verb 'had' followed by the past participle of the main verb. Therefore, the English translation also uses the past perfect tense to maintain the original meaning and context.",

Helen brings her coffee and bread and comforts her. She assures Jane that Brocklehurst is unpopular and his influence will be short-lived. Miss Temple invites the girls for tea in her room. She gives Jane a chance to speak. Jane talks about her life at Gateshead and mentions the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd. Miss Temple promises to write to him to lighten Jane's burden. Afterwards, Miss Temple and Helen engage in a lengthy discussion about French and Latin literature. Jane is impressed by Helen's erudition. However, Miss Temple seems very concerned about Helen's health. The next day, Miss Scatcherd plays a prank on Helen by putting a 'Dirty' sign on her head. Mr. Lloyd confirms Jane's report of her innocence in a few words, and Miss Temple shares this news with the entire school. Jane is reassured and can now focus on her studies.",

The use of 'Mr.' to denote Mr. Lloyd is a common title for male teachers in English-speaking countries. The word 'innocent' is synonymous with 'unschuldig,' and 'report' can be translated to 'Bericht.' The phrase 'shares this news with the entire school' is a direct translation of 'teilt diese Nachricht der gesamten Schule mit,' and 'can now focus on her studies once again' is a translation of 'jetzt wieder auf ihre Studien konzentrieren.'",

            "text": "I'm glad you found my translation accurate. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\nIn the original English text, 'Herr Lloyd confirms Jane's report to the whole school with a few words' and 'Jane apologizes and can now dedicate herself entirely to her studies' are two separate sentences. In the German translation, these sentences have been translated into two separate sentences as well: 'Herr Lloyd bestätigt Jane's Bericht der Gesamtschule mit wenigen Worten' and 'Jane entschuldigt sich und kann sich jetzt ganz auf ihre Studien konzentrieren.'\n\nThe first sentence in German, 'Herr Lloyd bestätigt Jane's Bericht der Gesamtschule mit wenigen Worten,' means 'Mr. Lloyd confirms Jane's report to the whole school with a few words.' This is a faithful translation of the original English sentence.\n\nThe second sentence in German, 'Jane entschuldigt sich und kann sich jetzt ganz auf ihre Studien konzentrieren,' means 'Jane apologizes and can now dedicate herself entirely to her studies.' This is also a faithful translation of the original English sentence.\n\nBoth sentences in the German translation preserve the original meaning and context of the English text. The use of the passive voice in the first German sentence ('Jane's report is confirmed by Mr. Lloyd to the whole school with a few words') is a common way to translate passive constructions in English into active constructions in German. This does not change the meaning of the sentence in any significant way.",

It discusses the notion of concurrent powers and exclusive powers as they relate to taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both the states and federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",
