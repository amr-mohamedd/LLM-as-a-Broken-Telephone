He asks Holofernes and Nathaniel for help in planning this pastime, and Holofernes suggests they create a piece based on the Nine Worthies.

They leave to plan their piece.\n\nTranslation:\n\nHolofernes en Nathaniel praten over Don Armado, met wie Nathaniel gesproken heeft. Ze spotten zijn ondergeschikte intelligentie aan, kritiserend zijn taalgebruik en bevestigden dat ze 'zulke ongeordende schrijvers' haaten. Armado, Moth en Costard binnentreden; Armado vertelt de geleerden dat de Koning een 'aangenaam vermaak, of show, of spektakel, of interlude' heeft gevraagd om voor de Prinses en haar gevolg te organiseren. Hij vraagt Holofernes en Nathaniel om hun hulp bij het planning van dit vermaak, en Holofernes voorschlagt dat ze een stukje maken gebaseerd op de Negen Edelen. Ze bespreken dan welke rollen de Edelen zullen spelen, waarbij Holofernes zegt dat hij zelf drie rollen zal opnemen. Ze vertrekken om hun stuk te planningen.\n\n(Note: In this translation, I assumed the source language to be English.

She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.

But after discovering his relationship with Wickham, I gained new insights. I was surprised about Wickham's past with Darcy, and had a suspicion that I had unknowingly come into contact with a woman of his, who was unknown to me. I delved deep into myself and was completely engrossed in my book, and came to the conclusion that I was 'blind, narrow-minded, unjust, and selfish.' I stayed with Darcy. Suddenly, after two hours in the garden, I returned and found Fitzwilliam and Darcy in each other's arms. (English translation)",

The captain took Cunegonde as loot and kept her in service for three months before eventually giving her to a Jewish merchant as a reward. Her services were later offered to the same Inquisitor, who inflicted unbearable punishments on Pangloss and Candide. Cunegonde was able to defend herself against both men. The story of Cunegonde ends here.\n\nLater, Candide and Cunegonde lived and ate together, but Don Issachar, one of her owners, controlled them. (English)",

Everyone wonders about the young man she has gone out with, and some of them are convinced that Jude is only posing as her cousin. The situation takes a serious turn because a similar incident occurred the year before: a young man had managed to seduce a student of the same college, maintaining that he was her cousin. The mistress inquires about the two photographs on Sue's dressing table. One is of Mr. Phillotson, and the other is of an unknown undergraduate. The next morning, when Sue does return, she is punished and kept in solitary confinement. The other students feel the punishment is too harsh and prepare to protest. In the evening it is discovered that Sue has escaped from a back window. She turns up at Jude's place. She is soaked and shivering with cold. Jude immediately takes her in and offers her some dry clothes and brandy. Sue is so tired that she falls asleep while relating her story.",

She said that this was the time and place, and asked if he was ready to sign off. He confirmed, saying that he would tell all, but not immediately. First, he had to see Luke. The governor agreed and asked if they could see him before they left.",

A boy tells him it is Christmas Day, and Scrooge realizes that the ghosts visited him all in one night. Scrooge buys a prize turkey and sends it to Bob Cratchit's house. Scrooge dresses in his best clothing and walks in the crowds with a smile. He gives a great deal of money to the portly gentleman who had asked him for a charitable donation yesterday. Scrooge continues to walk through the city and happily talks with everyone he meets. He visits Fred's house and has a wonderful time at the party. The next morning, Scrooge gets to work early. When Cratchit comes in late, Scrooge pretends to reprimand him, then gives him a raise. Scrooge continues his kindly ways, befriending everyone and becoming a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die. He never sees the ghosts again, but he keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart as well as anyone.",

Ermengarde goes on about how clever Sara must be because she can speak French. Sara does what any child would upon making a friend --she asks Ermengarde if she'd like to meet Emily, her doll. When she starts to tell fantastical stories about Emily, Ermengarde is amazed at how she's able to just make things up on the fly. Suddenly, Sara looks like she's in pain. Ermengarde asks her what is up with that, and Sara responds that she's in pain because she misses her father. Then, Ermengarde asks Sara if she'd like to be her best friend. Which is not weird at all. Sara agrees. Yay, BFF!",

Since we're starting out 'in the middle' of all the action, the Prologue quickly catches us up to speed. You know, just in case we've never heard of a little old thing called the Trojan War. Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since. Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.' By the way, Shmooperinos, the Prologue says absolutely NOTHING about Troilus and Cressida, the two characters Shakespeare named this play after. What's up with that?",

An actor in armor enters the stage and gestures to ancient Troy, where Greeks and Trojans have fiercely clashed on the battlefields of Troy. Since we are right in the thick of the fight, the Prologue quickly explains: you are most likely not acquainted with an old tale called the Trojan War. Here's a summary: the Greeks set sail over the 'Aegean Sea' to sack Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris had stolen Helen, the wife of the Greek King, Menelaus, and was living with her. That much is evident. The Prologue also cautions us that we are unlikely to find much pleasure in the performance, as 'during the war' not much good transpires. Curiously, the Prologue makes no reference to Troilus and Cressida, the characters after whom Shakespeare titled the play. What's the joke there?",

On Sunday, an article appeared in Uncle Gemini's newspaper inviting her to Rome due to her remarkable qualities. Lady Henrietta was glad to see her friend again and made plans to travel the next day. She contacted Caspar Goodwood in Florence and visited the Uffizi museum to see her beloved painting. During a meeting with Caspar Goodwood at the museum, they decided to travel to Rome the following day. Uncle Gemini was indecisive due to his complicated feelings towards Henrietta, but eventually granted his consent for her to travel with him the next day.)",

Mr. Irwine is playing chess with his mother, Mrs. Irwine, a socialite. Mr. Irwine is a bachelor because he has chosen to take care of his mother and two unmarried sisters, one of whom is chronically ill, rather than have his own family. Joshua Rann, the cobbler and parish clerk of Hayslope, comes to see Mr. Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah. In particular, Mr. Rann complains about the wheelwright, Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made disparaging remarks about Mr. Irwine and Rann. Mr. Irwine laughs off the insults and tells Rann to leave Maskery to his own business. As Rann is leaving, Captain Arthur Donnithorne arrives to ask Mr. Irwine to go riding with him. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landlord, Squire Donnithorne. Known throughout the village as 'the young squire,' he is a dashing man who is staying at the Squire's estate to recover from an injury in the army. Rann tells both Mr. Irwine and Captain Donnithorne about the death of Thias Bede, Adam's father",

Today, we will discuss innovative approaches to renewable energy sources and their implementation in our daily lives. I am pleased to introduce our first keynote speaker, Professor Jan van Dijk from the University of Amsterdam.'\n\nB. 'Professor van Dijk, the floor is yours.'\n\nII. Keynote speech by Professor Jan van Dijk:\nA. 'Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests. I am honored to be here today to talk about the latest developments in solar energy technology. Solar energy is becoming increasingly important in our quest for sustainable energy solutions. The Netherlands, with its abundant sunshine, is an ideal place for the implementation of solar energy.'\n\nB. 'Recent advancements in solar cell technology have led to significant improvements in efficiency and cost. For instance, the development of perovskite solar cells has shown a remarkable increase in efficiency, making them a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells.'\n\nC. 'Moreover, the integration of solar energy into our daily lives is becoming more accessible and affordable. Solar panels can now be installed on rooftops, and solar power can be stored in batteries for use during peak hours or when the sun is not shining. This decentralization of energy production is a game-changer in the energy sector.'\n\nIII. Q&A session:\nA. 'Question from the audience: What about the environmental impact of producing solar panels? Are they truly sustainable?'\n\nB. 'Professor van Dijk: That's a valid concern. While the production of solar panels does require some resources and energy, the environmental impact is significantly lower than that of traditional energy sources. Moreover, the environmental footprint of solar panels is decreasing as technology advances and production methods improve.'\n\nC. 'Question from the audience: What are the main challenges in implementing solar energy on a larger scale?'\n\nD. 'Professor van Dijk: One of the main challenges is the intermittency of solar energy. Solar panels produce energy only when the sun is shining, so energy storage and grid integration are crucial for a stable energy supply. Additionally, the initial investment for solar panel installation can be high, but the long-term savings and environmental benefits make it a",

She establishes a routine in their new home, and she keeps herself hopeful by setting aside a chair or books for her husband and otherwise behaving as if he lived there, too. Her father informs her that there is a place that she can stand on the sidewalk during certain hours which is overlooked by a window in the prison which her husband may sometimes look out. Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks. He notices that she is there every day, and he mocks her for knowing someone in the prison, pretending to guillotine the whole family with his saw. During December, a crowd of five hundred including Jacques Four and the Vengeance descend on Lucie while she is walking near the prison. She is frightened, but her father reassures her that they will not harm her. Madame Defarge walks by and salutes them. Charles is summoned to appear in court the next day",

While they spoke, they heard distant sounds of trumpets and muskets. Hamlet grew agitated and saw this as a sign that his uncle and stepfather, the new king, were alone, drunk and celebrating. Suddenly, a ghost appeared. Hamlet called out to it as 'King, father; King of Denmark,' and led it away for Hamlet's soliloquy and revelations. The ghost spoke only to Hamlet. Horatius and Marcellus tried to stop Hamlet, fearing danger and even their own death; but Hamlet, disregarding his friends' warnings, followed the Ghost.",

Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate.

On the other hand, Bulstrode is Lydgates main backer in the town, where he anticipates serious oppositions to his plans for medical reform. Lydgate, therefore, attends the meeting in a confused state. There is heated discussion much of personal, among the members who have earlier assembled. Lydgate comes in last and finds them equally divided. Ultimately, his casting vote is decided by his smarting ego. Mr. Wrench, an old style medical practitioner, declares that it is well known that Lydgate will vote will Bulstrode. Incensed, Lydgate does just that. So Mr. Tyke becomes the hospital chaplain. Farebrother meanwhile, continues to meet Lydgate with the same friendliness as before. But his skepticism and tolerant attitude dont impress Lydgate favorably.",

The conversation between the Duchess and Alice is packed with statements and the moral of each of these statements. This is enough to disorient Alice, since she has never thought that everything that she said would eventually have a moral. Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle. The Mock Turtle, sitting on a little rocky ledge, is sad and constantly sighing. Alice requests the Mock Turtle to tell her, his history. The Mock Turtle very proudly lists the various subjects that were taught to him. The subjects include, Reeling and Writhing and the different branches of Arithmetic . Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day. The Mock turtle asserts that it is 'because of this that they are called lessons'.",

Tijdens de avondvergadering der Coles ontdekte Harriet dat mr. Martin aanwezig was geweest bij de Coxes. Geruchten verspreidden zich dat de dochter van de Coxes hem wilde huwen. Om Harriet te vermaak en te beschermen, begeleidde Emma haar op winkeltocht. Onverwacht ontmoetten ze Frank en Mrs. Weston. Frank lijkte vriendelijk, maar hij stapte naar zijzij en liet dat Mrs. Weston de groetjes uitwisselen. Emma weigerde hem te erkennen, want hij was later gepland om Hartfield te bezoeken, maar dan verscheen Mrs. Bates op het winkelcentrum om Emma te vragen over Janes nieuwe piano-forte. In hun gesprek onthulde Mrs. Bates dat mr. Knightley de laatste pakketten van het seizoen aan haar had gestuurd, wat een bijzondere betekenis had voor haar.\n\n(Note: In this translation, I assumed",

Zij schoonmaakte het huis van Banker White. Tom had vroeger als paardenschilder gewerkt bij het huis van de White's, maar omdat hij daar verveeld en onbetrouwbaar was, verloor hij die baan. Nu doet hij verschillende kleine taken en is hij erg gelukkig. Zij komt regelmatig om zijn huurkamers te schoonmaken, en hij heeft een vreemde, bewuste benadering van levenservaringen. Hij wil zaken doen, maar hij selecteert bepaalde ervaringen en leeft ze uit bewust. Bijvoorbeeld, na zich in Helen White te zijn verliefd, beperkt hij zijn gedachten over haar. Een avond besluit hij dat het waard is om te drinken en probeert het. Hij koopt een fles whiskey en gaat ongeveer een mijl noordelijk van de stad, waar hij zich op een grasbank zit en dronken raakt. In zijn dronkenschap gaat hij en praat met George Willard over Helen",

In mijn tuin vond ik plotseling Isabella's hond vastgebonden in een stuk linnen en op het randje van de dood. Ik redde hem en hield hem in leven. De dokter vroeg over Heathcliff en vertelde me dat ze hem de vorige nacht gezien hadden. Dit vond Ellen verbaasd, en toen zij aanwezig was, was hij verdwenen. Ellen koos ervoor om Edgar erover niet te vertellen, omdat hij met Catherine was. De dokter riep iedereen bijeen voor een korte pauze. Zij waren allen onder invloed van Catherine. Uiteindelijk kwam een dienstmeisje om te melden dat Isabella was vertrokken met Heathcliff. Zij had dit geleerd van een andere bron die hen samen had gezien tijdens de nacht. Linton werd stil, beweerd dat Isabella vrijwillig was vertrokken. Hij eiste stilte, niet omdat zij hem had verlaten, maar omdat zij hem had verlaten.\n\n(I have translated the text from Dutch to English while preserving the original meaning and context.)",

But, here again, James is hinting at greater intimacy between Maisie's two stepparents. You guessed it: foreshadowing. Shortly after this conversation with Sir Claude, Maisie hears from Mrs. Wix that he has been secretly seeing Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix is convinced of this. Maisie has a hard time accepting that Sir Claude would have lied to her. But soon enough, she gets proof that he has been seeing Mrs. Beale when he takes her to her father's house to see her. Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts. Maisie realizes that this means she won't get to see Mrs. Wix or say goodbye--but only after it's too late.",

The boys laughed when the gentleman was in pursuit, and Oliver was arrested by a man whose wallet had been stolen. Oliver maintained his innocence, but no one believed him, and a police officer took Oliver away. (In this translation 'Fagin's game with people' refers to 'the people who were in the hands of the boys.')",

Cyrano proposes that he join his eloquence to Christian's good looks to create the perfect lover for Roxane. He will write some eloquent speeches for Christian to deliver to Roxane as his own.

The Musketeer believes that Cyrano must have undergone a transformation that means it is safe to talk about his nose. He impudently stares at Cyrano's nose, asking what the smell could be. Cyrano cries, 'It's pigshit. and floors the Musketeer with a blow.",

She wants to make the party elaborate and lovely, and she offers to pay for all of it. Marmee consents, but only in order to teach Amy a lesson about trying to present herself as something she is not. The party ends up costing more than Amy plans. She must reschedule the picnic because it is rainy and set up everything again the next day. When she goes out to buy lobster, she runs into a friend of Laurie's. He sees the lobster, which was considered low-class food at the time, and she is very embarrassed, although she manages to recover and charm him. Finally, the party begins, but only one person shows up. During the party, Amy is delightful and merry, but she is very disappointed at the way things have turned out. Her family is very kind and tactful",

Marmee agrees, but only if she behaves. The vacation turns out to be more complicated than planned. She has to move the picnic due to rain and everything is restored the next day. During the rabbit hunting season, she meets a friend of Laurie's. He sees rabbits as food for the working class of the past, and she is very sad, but eventually goes with him. In the end, the vacation really gets going, but only one person shows up at the parties.

When the First Senator denies any knowledge of a military leak, Aufidius produces a letter that he had received four days earlier stating that the Romans have raised an army against the Volscians under the leadership of Cominius, Marcius, and Titus Lartius.

The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.'

Tommo had spent approximately two months in the valley, and his leg felt good, allowing him to walk easily. One day, Tommo built a small 'popgun' from bamboo for a six-year-old boy, who was amazed when Tommo shot it. A few days later, groups of men and women approached Tommo and asked for additional supplies. He granted their requests, and they stayed with him for about ten days. Tommo hid his shoes, which he had brought from the ship, in his hiding place. One day, Marheyo showed interest, and Tommo gave them to him as a gift. Marheyo wore them as a strange collar around his chest. The Yawanawá people use them little, but 'mat making,' or 'tappa,' is a custom of the women.
