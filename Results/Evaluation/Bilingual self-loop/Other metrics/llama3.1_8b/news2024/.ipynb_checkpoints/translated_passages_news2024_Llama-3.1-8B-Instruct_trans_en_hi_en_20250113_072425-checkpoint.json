            "text": "France manager Didier Deschamps says his decision to leave captain Kylian Mbappe out of the squad for this month's Nations League double-header is a 'one-off'.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward was not selected for upcoming matches against Israel and Italy.\n\nMbappe, 25, was left out of France's squad in October for two Nations League matches as a precaution given he had just returned from injury and had been expected to return for selection this month.\n\n'I've had discussions with him, it is a decision that I took for this block of matches only,' Deschamps said at a news conference on Thursday. 'Kylian wanted to come.'\n\nThe forward, who joined Real Madrid on a free transfer last summer from Paris St-Germain, has struggled for form since moving to the Bernabeu.\n\nMbappe has scored eight goals in 15 appearances for the La Liga club but has only netted once in his past five games.\n\nReal, who won both the Champions League and La Liga last season, were beaten 4-0 by rivals Barcelona last month and trail the Catalans by nine points in the league.\n\nMbappe, a World Cup winner in 2018, has scored 48 goals in 86 appearances for France.",

But the thorough nature of an inquiry like this ensures it can still shock.\n\nTake a four-minute exchange at just after 11 this morning. The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses. The stage has been set for the next act of this, still shocking, drama.",

It is possible that the correct location is 'Sirensister' is not a known location, and the correct location is 'Sirenster' or 'Sirenster Road' which is a road in Cheltenham. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the correct location. \nAlso, the translation of 'टेक्सबरी रोड' as 'Texbury Road' is not entirely accurate, as 'टेक्सबरी' is a common name for a road in Cheltenham, but it is not a direct translation of the word 'Texbury'. A more accurate translation would be 'Tewkesbury Road' or 'Tewkesbury Road, Cheltenham'. \nHowever, I have translated the passage as per the original text, and the translation is accurate in the context of the original text.

Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

He carried on driving until coming to a stop when almost the entire cab started glowing.\n\nThe owner had been filling the tank when someone hopped into the cabin and drove away.\n\nThe suspect crossed the San Fernando Valley through a mostly empty highway and tried to run away by foot, but was arrested shortly after.",

Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK.

At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

Human translation may vary.   Translation Review: The translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor errors and awkward phrasing. The original text is in Hindi, and the translation may not fully capture the nuances and idioms used in the source language. Some sentences may sound a bit formal or stilted in English. To improve the translation, a human translator should review and revise the text to ensure that it flows smoothly and accurately conveys the original meaning.  Some specific issues to consider:  1.

A separate trial last year found Trump sexually assaulted Carroll, so it meant he couldn't repeat his denials and had to stick to what was relevant in the case.\n\nCourt returns tomorrow for closing arguments and the jury to be sent off for deliberations.

Payne, who worked for the King and Camilla for five years until 2021, also told the BBC's Newshour programme he's sure the King will be keen to return to his public engagements once and if it is deemed prudent. 'He will be deeply frustrated that he can't go out and meet people. 'He really, really enjoys that. He comes back absolutely fired up from all of the conversations.'",

We're closing our coverage now, but before we go here's a recap from today's show.\n\nWe heard from Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who acknowledged that families have been let down over decades by the infected blood scandal, though he wouldn't be drawn on the amount of compensation due.\n\nOn Ukraine he said the west 'took its eye off the ball' and he doesn't want a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nShadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting outlined plans to cut NHS waiting lists and said a future Labour government would ensure victims of the infected blood scandal are compensated.\n\nWe also had an interview with Leonid Volkov, former aide to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is 'bluffing'.\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

Parliament officials were seen cleaning blood drops off the floor following the fight.\n\nLawyer and rights activist Mr Atalay lost his parliamentary seat earlier this year.\n\nMr Sik was defending Mr Atalay against attacks from AK party lawmakers when the fight broke out.\n\nMr Atalay ran for a seat from jail after being sentenced to 18 years in prison, in 2022, following a controversial trial that also saw the award-winning philanthropist Osman Kavala jailed for life.",

If the craft touches down gently on the lunar surface, it will be the first American mission to do so since the famed Apollo missions in the 1960s/70s.\n\nThe Vulcan left Cape Canaveral at 07:18 GMT (02:18 EST). The Peregrine lander is expected to attempt its landing on 23 February.\n\nJust hours after launch, Astrobotic, the company behind the Moon mission, said the spacecraft ran into a technical hitch involving its solar panels.\n\nAstrobotic said engineers were working on the issue and would provide updates when it had more information.\n\nIn the future, the Vulcan rocket will be launching many of America's national security missions.",

Tottenham Hotspur are interested in signing a striker this summer and their target is Bournemouth's Dominic Solanke. They are keen to keep him after he scored 21 goals in 42 games for Bournemouth, but manager Ange Postecoglou has said he is willing to let him go if the right offer comes in. The Australian manager has said he is looking to bring in a new striker to strengthen the team and believes Solanke could be the right man for the job.

While per capita GDP is now also up for the first time in two years, it is still lower now than two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turning point? Or will they focus on years of sluggish growth and declining living standards before that?\n\nThe economic hangover from the worst health crisis in a century and the worst energy crisis in a generation was always going to be tough, but the economy now appears to be returning to normal. If sustained, that is a marked improvement.\n\nAnd with that, we're closing our live coverage.

It predates the time of the Biblical King David and King Solomon and is characteristic of the Canaan region on the eastern Mediterranean coast.",

He got lost in treacherous terrain and fell to his death.\n\nHis family hoped the viral frenzy would end when his body was found last week. But it did not.\n\nMany are now asking one question: why did it take 29 days to find him?\n\nWe’ve spent time in Tenerife over the past month inside the search for Jay, reporting on the riddle.\n\nWhat we've seen raises both questions and answers.",

            "text": "We expected a fiery day on Paula Vennells' last day at the inquiry, and that's what we got.\n\nThe former Post Office CEO faced questions from a several lawyers representing sub-postmasters, who did not hold back.\n\n'You preach compassion but don't practice it,' one said right at the beginning.\n\nThe room was jam packed - I saw a couple of people actually looking for spare seats in the chamber. There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.\n\nOne sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.\n\nThe most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was 'bored' listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'lacked passion'.\n\nBy then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.\n\nThank you for joining us today. We will be closing our live page shortly. You can read more about today's events here and about the Horizon scandal here.",

The A5 upgrade is therefore one of the most important strategic economic investments.”",

            "text": "Hyperia was closed the day after it first opened in May\n\nThe UK’s tallest rollercoaster has reopened after another breakdown halted rides. Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station. 'Stoppages are perfectly normal and commonly experienced in theme parks everywhere.”\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and on X, external.

Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

A long-promised, but much-delayed, ban on no-fault evictions is included and now imminent.\n\nThe Renters’ Rights Bill, covering England, also includes Labour manifesto pledges to end manufactured rental bidding wars and allow tenants to request keeping a pet – which a landlord could not unreasonably refuse.\n\nThere will also be an extension of social housing safety rules, known as Awaab’s Law, into the private rental sector. Expect the detail of all this to be heavily scrutinised, not least by the House of Lords.\n\nCampaigners want legislation to block any potential loopholes that would allow landlords to kick out tenants by the back door.\n\nLandlords are pleading for a properly functioning court system to process justified evictions. On the day official data shows rents rising at a near-record 8.6% a year, they warn any exodus from the sector would reduce supply and increase the cost of renting at an even faster rate.",

            "text": "The former subpostmistress, Seema Misra, who was jailed for 15 months over the Horizon IT, has rejected an apology from a former Post Office boss who at the time of her conviction called it 'brilliant news'.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC after the Inquiry session this morning, Misra said: 'How can I accept the apology? They need to apologise to my 10-year-old, they took his mum away on his birthday.\n\n“I was eight weeks pregnant - they need to apologise to my youngest son. It was terrible. I haven't accepted the apologies,' she added.\n\nDavid Smith told the inquiry this morning that in hindsight his email about Misra's case was 'poorly thought through'.\n\n'Brilliant news. Well done. Please pass on my thanks to the team,' Smith said in a 2010 email to colleagues.\n\nMisra was handed a 15-month jail term while being eight weeks pregnant.\n\nShe had been wrongly accused of stealing £70,000 from her Post Office branch in the village of West Byfleet in Surrey and was sent to Bronzefield prison on the day of her eldest son's 10th birthday.",

The 41-year-old former Wales international was three times over the limit when he was arrested in Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, on 7 July. Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday the former scrum half - who gave the court his full name as William Mike Phillips - was in an Audi A4 when the offence happened. The court was told 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath was recorded in a reading. The legal limit is 35.\n\nThe ban will be cut by 25 weeks, if Phillips, who also represented the British and Irish Lions, finishes an awareness course by 8 January 2026. Phillips was also fined £1,153 and ordered to pay £461 surcharge and £85 costs.",

'More than anything, she makes you feel seen.' 'I've never known pain that could last forever until I saw Hana in a casket,' she continued.
