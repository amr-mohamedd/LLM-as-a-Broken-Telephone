The man was driving in the wrong direction on the road and turned into a roundabout in the wrong direction, facing oncoming traffic.\n\nWhen police began the pursuit in the morning of September, they found that the Audi A4 had run a red light at the Wellingborough Road junction. Police then used a 'stinger' device at Overstone Gate to immobilise the vehicle.\n\nInside the vehicle, police found Class A drugs. The man later pleaded guilty to a series of charges, including driving recklessly, driving under the influence of drugs and failing to stop, at Northampton Crown Court. He was sentenced to 30 weeks in prison.\n\nDetective Constable Mae Taylor said: 'He was driving extremely recklessly while under the influence of drugs, fortunately no one was killed or seriously injured.'",

Approximately 30 minutes after the accident, a 22-year-old male was detained by police.\n\nThe accident took place on Wellington Road in Northampton, with nearby CCTV cameras capturing the entire incident. The police pursued the driver, who made multiple errors during the chase, including reversing and ignoring traffic signals, and refusing to stop at a red light.\n\nIn Northampton today, the Audi A4 driver refused to stop at a red light. Northamptonshire Police used a device called a 'stinger' near Overstone Park in Northampton to bring the vehicle to a stop.\n\nUpon searching the vehicle, police discovered class A drugs. Days later, the male appeared in court in Northampton, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, drink-driving, and failing to comply with police instructions. The male was sentenced to 30 weeks in prison.\n\nPC Matthew Corry of Northamptonshire Police stated: 'Fortunately, due to the drink-driving, no fatalities or serious injuries were caused.'",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

While per capita GDP is now also up for the first time in two years, it is still lower now than two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turning point? Or will they focus on years of sluggish growth and declining living standards before that?\n\nThe economic hangover from the worst health crisis in a century and the worst energy crisis in a generation was always going to be tough, but the economy now appears to be returning to normal. If sustained, that is a marked improvement.\n\nAnd with that, we're closing our live coverage.

Therefore, upgrading the A5 highway in the western region is the most strategically significant economic investment in the area.",

            "text": "A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting her twice in 1975 when she was 17.\n\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nMs Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.\n\nThe judge decided the case did not qualify for a two-year window for submitting claims that would otherwise fall outside the usual legal time limit, because Tyler's alleged conduct did not meet the criteria for posing a 'serious risk of physical injury'.\n\nTyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: 'We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.'\n\nThe singer has also denied claims in a separate continuing case filed by another woman in 2022.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

McLaren struggled relatively in Austin, they believe, because there were only a couple of corners at the end of the Esses that played to their strengths in medium-speed bends.\n\nBy contrast, the Circuit of the Americas has a lot of high-speed corners, and braking from high-speed into low-speed, and low-speed. The first two of these characteristics are strengths of Red Bull, the last Ferrari.\n\nMcLaren expect the next couple of circuits in Mexico and Brazil to be better for them than Austin. And they have upgrades coming.\n\nQatar should be strong for McLaren; Las Vegas favours Ferrari. Abu Dhabi - Red Bull are always strong there. But Verstappen could have it tied up before then at this rate.\n\nThe cars are so close that other factors can come into play, too - who has a better weekend, driver performance etc.",

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.\n\nThe force said Ronchi 'demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of other road users when he sped through a built-up residential area in such a reckless manner'.",

'There is currently no impact to TfL services and we are working closely with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre to respond to the incident.”",
