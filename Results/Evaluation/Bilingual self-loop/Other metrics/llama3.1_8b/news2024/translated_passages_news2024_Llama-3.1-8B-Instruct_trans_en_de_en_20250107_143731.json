And the answer, as often, was: 'No'.\n\nA word was used frequently today: 'Robust'. Postal workers described the system plagued by errors with these words.\n\nThe man who had led a short-lived mediation initiative – retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper – said that no one believed a solution had been found as long as the Post chiefs claimed the Horizon system was 'robust'.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear from the former Post chiefs. The stage is set for the next scene in this still-shocking drama series.",

Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

We're closing our coverage now, but before we go here's a recap from today's show.\n\nWe heard from Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who acknowledged that families have been let down over decades by the infected blood scandal, though he wouldn't be drawn on the amount of compensation due.\n\nOn Ukraine he said the west 'took its eye off the ball' and he doesn't want a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nShadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting outlined plans to cut NHS waiting lists and said a future Labour government would ensure victims of the infected blood scandal are compensated.\n\nWe also had an interview with Leonid Volkov, former aide to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is 'bluffing'.\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

Every time Vennell said she was not involved in the scandal, the audience laughed with her as she apologized.\n\nA postal employee told me that he actually felt a bit of sympathy for her when she said at the beginning of the day:\n\n'I'm sorry to have gotten you all so excited.'\n\nBut that changed after they had eaten, when Tim Moloney took over the cross-examination.\n\nThe turning point came when the audience felt sympathy for Vennell when she apologized for a birthday card example where postal workers on TV were boring and Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'showed no enthusiasm.'\n\nThen someone next to me said it was over.\n\nThanks for watching.

It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h).

Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday the former scrum half - who gave the court his full name as William Mike Phillips - was in an Audi A4 when the offence happened. The court was told 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath was recorded in a reading. The legal limit is 35.\n\nThe ban will be cut by 25 weeks, if Phillips, who also represented the British and Irish Lions, finishes an awareness course by 8 January 2026.

'More than anything, she makes you feel seen.' 'I've never known pain that could last forever until I saw Hana in a casket,' she continued. 'Our 10-year-old little brother had to learn how to write a eulogy for his sister before he even learned how to write essays.' The 14-year-old had debuted on the women's basketball team only the day before the shooting, she said, and she never got to see future birthdays, school dances and so many other milestones. Most of the shots fired that day hit Hana, she said.",

And both candidates were warned of what they could expect if they were elected as First Minister.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

His February campaign was heavily influenced by the Labour Party's decision to distance itself from candidate Azhar Ali, whose comments were largely seen as antisemitic. After his spring successes, Mr. Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two sides of the same coin, and both were thoroughly defeated.' Galloway was a member of the Labour Party until 2003, before sitting as an independent MP and member of the Respect Party for three parliamentary constituencies.\n\nWhat do you demand from the new government?",

            "text": "The previous owner said he had 'treasured' the goat all his life\n\nA pottery goat made by King Charles has sold for £8,500. The small ceramic animal, which had been treasured for 55 years by Canadian Raymond Patten, was auctioned in Staffordshire on Tuesday. It was given to him on his 21st birthday by a great aunt who worked as a cook at Cambridge University. 'I believe she knew the future King on a personal basis. I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.'
