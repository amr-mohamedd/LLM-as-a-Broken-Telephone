There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.\n\nOne sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.\n\nThe most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was 'bored' listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'lacked passion'.\n\nBy then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.\n\nThank you for joining us today.

The 36-year-old American won by unanimous decision at the BMO Stadium to extend his unbeaten record to 41 fights. A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez. 'If the money is right, we've got to fight,' said Crawford.\n• None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

            "text": "During that update, police said they had analysed the substance used in the attack on Wednesday, and had narrowed it down to two potential very strong alkalis.\n\nIt's worth remembering that alkalis are not difficult to come by. They can be found in many common household items from bicarbonate of soda to drain cleaner.\n\nBut not all of these substances are harmful to human health - it depends how strong they are.\n\nWeak alkalis are unlikely to cause any harm. In fact they can be consumed - such as baking soda in cakes.\n\nIt is products that contain strong alkalis like sodium hydroxide that cause damage , these are most commonly used in strong household cleaners and the paper industry.\n\nA common misconception is that is it only acids which are corrosive, but strong alkalis like this can also cause serious damage to humans.\n\nDepending on how long you are exposed, the type of exposure (ingestion or skin contact) and the dose it can cause severe burns to tissue, accumulation of fluid in the lungs and blindness.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

They need to apologise to my 10-year-old, they took his mum away on his birthday.\n\n“I was eight weeks pregnant - they need to apologise to my youngest son. It was terrible. I haven't accepted the apologies,' she added.\n\nDavid Smith told the inquiry this morning that in hindsight his email about Misra's case was 'poorly thought through'.\n\n'Brilliant news. Well done. Please pass on my thanks to the team,' Smith said in a 2010 email to colleagues.\n\nMisra was handed a 15-month jail term while being eight weeks pregnant.\n\nShe had been wrongly accused of stealing £70,000 from her Post Office branch in the village of West Byfleet in Surrey and was sent to Bronzefield prison on the day of her eldest son's 10th birthday.",

The 41-year-old former Wales international was three times over the limit when he was arrested in Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, on 7 July. Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday the former scrum half - who gave the court his full name as William Mike Phillips - was in an Audi A4 when the offence happened. The court was told 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath was recorded in a reading. The legal limit is 35.\n\nThe ban will be cut by 25 weeks, if Phillips, who also represented the British and Irish Lions, finishes an awareness course by 8 January 2026. Phillips was also fined £1,153 and ordered to pay £461 surcharge and £85 costs.",

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

The small ceramic animal, which had been treasured for 55 years by Canadian Raymond Patten, was auctioned in Staffordshire on Tuesday. It was given to him on his 21st birthday by a great aunt who worked as a cook at Cambridge University. 'I believe she knew the future King on a personal basis. I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'.

Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance.

Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",
