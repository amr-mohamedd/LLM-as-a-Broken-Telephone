Yet, a thorough investigation can still surprise someone.\n\nA four-minute dialogue at half past eleven. The former leader of the Conservative campaign, Lord Arbuthnot, recalled a meeting where Royal Mail told him again that there were no problems with the Horizon-IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then mentioned a few bugs that were considered harmless and where the investigations were stopped, and asked the former MP if he knew them. Each time he replied: 'No'.\n\nToday, the word'serious' was repeated: post officials described the system as such and said it was full of bugs.\n\nThe person responsible for a short mediation conversation - the retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, given what we know now, there was never a chance for a solution, because the Royal Mail director claimed that there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear from the former director of Royal Mail. The scenarios are ready for the next scene in this still suffocating drama.",

Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

Every time Vennells said she had nothing to do with the scandals, a sarcastic laugh echoed through the room and sarcastic comments were made.\n\nA subpostmaster told me that he even felt a little bit of sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut that all changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney started asking questions.\n\nThe turning point came when the prosecutor asked Vennells to apologise for an email in which she said she felt 'irritation' when she saw subpostmasters on TV, and that Jo Hamilton - who was sitting in the room - 'had no passion'.\n\nAt that moment, there was no sympathy left for anyone.\n\nThank you for following us today.

At 14, her life had only just begun. 'I can never do Hana justice by talking about her,' she said, praising her incandescence, joy, humour and ability to connect people. 'More than anything, she makes you feel seen.' 'I've never known pain that could last forever until I saw Hana in a casket,' she continued. 'Our 10-year-old little brother had to learn how to write a eulogy for his sister before he even learned how to write essays.'

Her life had only just begun when she was 14 years old. 'I can never go back to what Hana missed out on,' she said, praising her brilliant mind, her happiness, her sense of humor, and her gift to bring people together. 'She makes you visible, and everything else different.' 'I didn't know that pain could last so long until I saw Hana lying in a coffin,' she added. 'Our 10-year-old younger brother had to write an essay about his sister before he even knew how to write an essay.' The 14-year-old had made her debut in the women's team, she said yesterday, and she never got the chance to see future birthdays, school dances, and so many other milestones. Most of those points belonged to Hana, she said.",

And both candidates have been warned what awaits them if they become first minister.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

The founder of the Workers Party of Britain was not present at the by-elections at the Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the results. Michael Howard of Reform UK came in third place with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a massive turnaround from Galloway's election victory, when he won by more than 6,000 votes by voting against the Labour Party in the Gaza conflicts. His February campaign received considerable support, as the Labour Party decided not to support their candidate Azhar Ali due to comments widely condemned as antisemitic. After his early win this year, Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two sides of the same coin, and both took a slap in the face.' Until 2003, Galloway was a Labour MP, before serving three terms as an independent and Respect Party MP from 2003 to 2015.\n\nWhat do you expect from the new cabinet members?",
