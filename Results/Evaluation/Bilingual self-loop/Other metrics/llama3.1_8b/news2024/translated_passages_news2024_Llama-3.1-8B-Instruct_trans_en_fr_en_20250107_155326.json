That's how the Royal Mail executives described the system with multiple bugs.\n\nThe man behind a short-term mediation plan - the retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - stated, looking back, that there had never been a chance of finding a resolution as long as the Royal Mail executives maintained that everything was fine with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we will hear from the former Royal Mail executives. The stage is set for the next part of this dramatic surprise.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

While per capita GDP is now also up for the first time in two years, it is still lower now than two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turning point? Or will they focus on years of sluggish growth and declining living standards before that?\n\nThe economic hangover from the worst health crisis in a century and the worst energy crisis in a generation was always going to be tough, but the economy now appears to be returning to normal. If sustained, that is a marked improvement.\n\nAnd with that, we're closing our live coverage.

Even though household GDP has recorded growth for the first time in two years, it remains below what it was two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turnaround or focus on years of slow growth and a declining standard of living?\n\nThe economy is still recovering from the worst pandemic of the century and the worst energy crisis of a generation, but the economy seems to be returning to normal now. If this continues, it would be a significant improvement.\n\nAnd there you have it, we conclude our live coverage.

There was sarcastic laughter each time Vennells said she was not involved in the scandal, and the audience scoffed at her apologies.\n\nOne sub-postmaster told me he actually felt some sympathy for her during the first half of the day.\n\nBut things changed after lunch, when Tim Moloney took over questioning.\n\nThe most significant moment was when the audience booed Vennells for apologising for an email in which she said she was 'bored' listening to sub-postmasters on television, and that Jo Hamilton - who was in the room - 'lacked passion'.\n\nBy then, someone seated nearby told me, there was no sympathy left.\n\nThank you for joining us today. We will be closing our live page shortly. You can read more about today's events here and about the Horizon scandal here.",

Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station.

The 41-year-old former Wales international was three times over the limit when he was arrested in Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, on 7 July. Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court heard on Wednesday the former scrum half - who gave the court his full name as William Mike Phillips - was in an Audi A4 when the offence happened. The court was told 108 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath was recorded in a reading. The legal limit is 35.\n\nThe ban will be cut by 25 weeks, if Phillips, who also represented the British and Irish Lions, finishes an awareness course by 8 January 2026. Phillips was also fined £1,153 and ordered to pay £461 surcharge and £85 costs.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

It said there was no evidence customer data had been compromised and there was currently no impact on TfL services.

            "text": "Good Lord! We have a Labour government! exclaimed a cabinet member, beaming with joy at the idea that had just emerged in their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters had sent the Conservatives to the slaughter.\n\nFor seven days, the Prime Minister had to face a delicate situation abroad - Joe Biden's presidency dominated the NATO summit.\n\nAt home, the Attorney General felt the need to plan prisoner releases (it's not usual for a politician to take a decision of this kind on their own initiative), and doubts persist over the survival of the Port Talbot steelworks.\n\nIn other words, the Labour Party is already facing the tasks imposed by the government - not the options they would have chosen.\n\nBut on Wednesday, their own plans will be put into action, with all the pomp and ceremony that Westminster can offer - the presence of the king, the throne (where is it?), the trumpets, the honours, and the emotion.\n\nThe first 'royal speech' will list the laws that the government hopes to adopt in its first year of what the Labour Party already hopes will be a decade of power.",
