The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses.

Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

'He will be deeply frustrated that he can't go out and meet people. 'He really, really enjoys that. He comes back absolutely fired up from all of the conversations.'",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

            "text": "On 2 August 2022 Taiwan television channels began live tracking a US government jet heading north across the South China Sea on course for Taiwan. On board was then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThousands turned out to watch her plane touch down at Taipei’s old Songshan airport. The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent. Only later did it admit that for the first time ever China had fired ballistic missiles over the top of the island, into the Pacific Ocean.",

Riders were stuck on board Hyperia, at Thorpe Park in Surrey, for an hour on Saturday. The ride was closed for the rest of the day. It reopened at 10:00 BST on Sunday, with queue times at about 90 minutes, according to the park’s app. Hyperia first launched on 24 May but was closed the following day until 12 June while staff carried out a number of technical safety checks.\n\nThe ride is 236ft (72m) in height and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). In a statement on Saturday the theme park said there were no safety concerns for the people temporarily stuck on Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests were held on the lift hill for approximately one hour before the ride was restarted and the train was brought back into the ride station. 'Stoppages are perfectly normal and commonly experienced in theme parks everywhere.”\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and on X, external.

They need to apologize to my 10-year-old son, whom I had to leave behind to attend my mother's birthday.\n\n'I was eight weeks pregnant - they need to apologize to my youngest son. It was a horrific nightmare. I cannot accept that apology,' she added.\n\nDavid Smith said in court today that, looking back, his email on the matter 'had no support from the opposing side.'\n\n'It was a joke. Congratulations. Thank you and congratulations to my team,' Smith said in an email he sent to his colleagues in 2010.\n\nMisra was sentenced to 15 months in prison while eight weeks pregnant.\n\nShe was convicted of stealing £70,000 from the Royal Mail office in West Byfleet, Surrey, and was transferred to Bronzefield Prison when her eldest son was just 10 years old.",

            "text": "A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting her twice in 1975 when she was 17.\n\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nMs Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.\n\nThe judge decided the case did not qualify for a two-year window for submitting claims that would otherwise fall outside the usual legal time limit, because Tyler's alleged conduct did not meet the criteria for posing a 'serious risk of physical injury'.\n\nTyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: 'We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.'\n\nThe singer has also denied claims in a separate continuing case filed by another woman in 2022.",

The 36-year-old American won by unanimous decision at the BMO Stadium to extend his unbeaten record to 41 fights. A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",
