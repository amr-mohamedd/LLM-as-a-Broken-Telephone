When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.

When she read about the reasons behind his actions in his relationship with Bingley and Jane, she initially refused to accept the reasons for his interest in Jane, considering them insignificant and believing that he acted out of concern for her family. However, when she began reading about the reasons behind his actions in his relationship with Wickham, she started to read them more clearly. She quickly realized that she knew very little about Wickham before he spoke about him and Darcy, and wondered why she hadn't noticed the inconsistency in his words when speaking to strangers. Continuing to read and reflect, she realized that she was 'blind, biased, one-sided, and lacking in compassion,' and believed that Darcy's reasons were correct. After a two-hour walk in the park, she returned home and found that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to bid her farewell.",

Ermengarde talks about Sara's French skills because she can speak French. Sara does everything a child does when meeting a new friend - she asks Ermengarde if she wants to see Emily, her toy, or not. When Sara starts telling imaginative stories about Emily, Ermengarde is surprised to realize that Sara thinks very quickly. The unexpected result is that Sara looks as if she is in pain. Ermengarde asks her if she is alright and Sara replies that she is in pain because she is thinking about her father. Then, Ermengarde asks Sara if she wants to be her friend. That's not too special. Sara agrees. Congratulations to the two new friends!",

Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president.

When Charles Darnay arrived, the two men exchanged polite greetings, and after the old servant left, Darnay informed his father-in-law that he was cutting ties with his family and France. Although cold and stern, the man clearly could not misunderstand the discontent of his son-in-law. Darnay disliked his father-in-law and felt threatened, and this discontent stemmed from the name Evremond, which made him uncomfortable. Before they parted ways, the man asked about Darnay's relationship with Dr. Manette and Lucie, and then he smiled enigmatically. A day later, the man was stabbed to death by a member of the Jacquerie.",

Mr. Irwine is playing chess with his mother, Mrs. Irwine, a socialite. Mr. Irwine is a bachelor because he has chosen to take care of his mother and two unmarried sisters, one of whom is chronically ill, rather than have his own family. Joshua Rann, the cobbler and parish clerk of Hayslope, comes to see Mr. Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah. In particular, Mr. Rann complains about the wheelwright, Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made disparaging remarks about Mr. Irwine and Rann. Mr. Irwine laughs off the insults and tells Rann to leave Maskery to his own business. As Rann is leaving, Captain Arthur Donnithorne arrives to ask Mr. Irwine to go riding with him. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landlord, Squire Donnithorne. Known throughout the village as 'the young squire,' he is a dashing man who is staying at the Squire's estate to recover from an injury in the army. Rann tells both Mr. Irwine and Captain Donnithorne about the death of Thias Bede, Adam's father",

Jane continues to pay attention to the relationship between St. John and Rosamond, who often visits the school when she knows St. John will be there. Rosamond asks Jane to draw her portrait, and as she is working on it one day, St. John pays her a visit. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. She offers to draw him a duplicate, and then boldly declares that he ought to marry Rosamond. St. John admits that he loves her and is tempted by her beauty, but he explains that he refuses to allow worldly affection to interfere with his holy duties. The flirtatious, silly, and shallow Rosamond would make a terrible wife for a missionary. Suddenly, St. John notices something on the edge of Jane's paper and tears off a tiny piece--Jane is not certain why. With a peculiar look on his face, he hurries from the room",

Jane continued to observe the relationship between St. John and Rosamond, who frequently visited the school and knew that St. John would be present. Rosamond asked Jane to paint a portrait of herself, and when Jane was working on it one day, St. John came to visit her. He gave her a new book of poetry and looked at the portrait. She offered to paint a copy for him, and then dared to say that he should marry Rosamond. St. John admitted that he loved her and was drawn to her beauty, but he explained that he refused to allow worldly feelings to penetrate the sacred responsibility of his mission. Rosamond was a young, innocent, and irresponsible girl, and she was not suitable to become the wife of a missionary. Just like Jane, St. John had found something on Jane's paper and tore a small piece - Jane didn't know why. With a strange expression on his face, he quickly left the room.",

He and the stranger have a discussion about Dinah, and Mr. Casson says he believes it is inappropriate for a woman to preach on the village green. As Dinah begins to preach, she draws in the villagers with her soft, loving voice, and the stranger stays to listen to her despite his reservations about a woman preacher. Dinah's sermon tells about the love Jesus has for the poor and encourages the townspeople to give up their sins and do good in the world. The villagers accept her slowly, and by the time she concludes her preaching, many of them are moved to tears",

On the way to the governor's mansion, Hester and Pearl are accosted by a group of Puritan children. When they taunt Pearl, she shows a temper as fiery as her appearance, driving the children off with her screams and threats. Reaching the Governor's large, elaborate, stucco frame dwelling, Hester and Pearl are admitted by a bondsman. Inside a heavy oak hall, Hester and Pearl stand before Governor Bellingham's suit of armor. In its curved, polished breastplate, both Hester's scarlet A and Pearl are distorted. Meanwhile, as Hester contemplates her daughter's changed image, a small group of men approaches. Pearl becomes quiet out of curiosity about the men who are coming down the path.",

Pearl wore a special outfit for the occasion, a red cloak adorned with a golden brooch. When they arrived at the governor's house, Hester and Pearl were stopped by a group of Puritan children. When the children called out Pearl's name, she stood up with a determined face fitting her image, causing the children to cry and threaten. When they finally reached the large stones, Hester and Pearl were led in by a member of the staff. In a large wooden hallway, Hester and Pearl stood before the governor's armor. On the armor, the distorted image of Hester and Pearl was written in large red letters. When Hester thought about the distorted image of her daughter, a small group approached.

Grandfather says particularly long prayers that morning and reads aloud from the Bible. He thanks God for Christmas. Narrator-Jim remarks that Grandfather had a special talent for saying prayers. They have waffles and sausage for breakfast. Jake tells them that the Shimerdas were happy with their presents, even Ambrosch. That afternoon Jake and Jim play marbles while Otto writes a letter to his mother, as he does every Christmas. At 4pm Mr. Shimerda shows up with his rabbit-skin winter gear. He's there to thank them for everything they've done for his family. He seems to be very content, though it's only a break from his constant sadness. At 9pm, he leaves to go home. As he departs, he makes the sign of the cross over Grandmother and tells her that she's a good woman. He adds that the prayers of all good people are good.",

Isabel wonders if she gave a false image of herself to Osmond when they first got involved. Isabel feels certain that Osmond hates her, because she doesn't have a sense of 'tradition.' Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life. We discover the grim truth behind their relationship: Osmond has gradually gained total control of Isabel, who was once so proud and independent. Isabel and Osmond have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Osmond is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is. She thinks that it is better for him to think that he was wrong all along, although, in fact, he was all too right. Isabel stays up until four in the morning thinking things over. She can't shake off the alarming image of Madame Merle and Osmond in cahoots.",

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death . A fellow playwright, Thomas Middleton, may have written the snazzy songs in this scene.",

On the other hand, Bulstrode is Lydgates main backer in the town, where he anticipates serious oppositions to his plans for medical reform. Lydgate, therefore, attends the meeting in a confused state. There is heated discussion much of personal, among the members who have earlier assembled. Lydgate comes in last and finds them equally divided. Ultimately, his casting vote is decided by his smarting ego. Mr. Wrench, an old style medical practitioner, declares that it is well known that Lydgate will vote will Bulstrode. Incensed, Lydgate does just that. So Mr. Tyke becomes the hospital chaplain. Farebrother meanwhile, continues to meet Lydgate with the same friendliness as before. But his skepticism and tolerant attitude dont impress Lydgate favorably.",

The diversions, however, prove to be quite different than one might expect. It is the Lilliputian court custom that men seeking political office demonstrate their agility in rope dancing, among other things. How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on.

Jerry Cruncher, employed by Tellson's as a runner and messenger, wakes up in his small apartment, located in an unsavory London neighborhood. He begins the day by yelling at his wife for 'praying against' him; he throws his muddy boot at her. Around nine o'clock, Cruncher and his young son camp outside Tellson's Bank, where they await the bankers' instructions. When an indoor messenger calls for a porter, Cruncher takes off to do the job.

A crowd of somber, dreary-looking people has gathered outside the door of a prison in seventeenth-century Boston. The building's heavy oak door is studded with iron spikes, and the prison appears to have been constructed to hold dangerous criminals. No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately. This is true of the citizens of Boston, who built their prison some twenty years earlier. The one incongruity in the otherwise drab scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door. The narrator suggests that it offers a reminder of Nature's kindness to the condemned; for his tale, he says, it will provide either a 'sweet moral blossom' or else some relief in the face of unrelenting sorrow and gloom",

He bought a bottle of whiskey and walked a mile north of the town, where he sat on a patch of green grass and got drunk. When he was drunk, he stood up and talked to George Willard about Helen. George was initially surprised, but eventually they became close friends. Tom decided that since he was drunk, he didn't need to try it again.",

Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'. Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's pride if he had not affronted hers.

The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas was a tradesman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, the eldest of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical girl.",

Many women had criticized Darcy for being proud and arrogant, but Charlotte defended him by saying that 'pride' was an unavoidable consequence of a young man's social position and talents. Elizabeth agreed with her to some extent and said that she could easily forgive Darcy's 'pride' if he did not make her feel uncomfortable. Mary was thinking about the difference between 'pride' and 'caution.' This chapter also provides an overview of the Lucas family - Mr. William Lucas had been a merchant and was knighted when he was mayor. He was a friendly and polite man. His wife was kind, but too trusting. They had many children, and their eldest daughter was Charlotte, a young, intelligent, talented, and practical girl.",

Although she had lost hope in herself, she still suspected that Fred's hope would be fulfilled. At 3 am, the old man called her when she was sitting beside him. He asked her to open the box and take out his will, as he had made two copies of it. He wanted her to destroy one of the two copies. Mary refused to take any action that could make her a suspect. She emphasized that he should call a witness or wait until morning to see a lawyer. Featherstone tried to bribe her with cash. She refused, trying to calm him down, but he was too angry and disappointed. Finally, he calmed down. A little later, Mary looked at him and realized that he had passed away.",

This mystery man seems to him just like 'my king's ideal knight,' especially because he followed his conscience above all else and was completely dedicated to one woman. He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was. Even though his position on the throne made him especially vulnerable to criticism, he appears blameless. Who could wish for a better life for his only son, or hope for more for his son's sons than that they resemble such an excellent father--Albert the Good? Now the author addresses the widowed queen, telling her to be strong and endure in the memory of the light they two shared. He ends by saying something along the lines of, 'May Albert's love, the love of her children, and the love of her people surround her until God's love reunites her with her husband again.'",

He returns to the shore to get his piece of wood, planning to try and float across, but the yard has floated back out to sea. David is now miserable. He begins eating raw shellfish. Sometimes he manages to keep them down, and other times they make him extremely sick. He is especially depressed because he can see a church and several houses on the mainland, but he knows he cannot cross the river. The next day he sees, to his surprise, a red deer, which he realizes must have swum the river. He also discovers that he has lost all his money after the shipwreck. He sees some fisherman, and wildly hails them from the shore. But, to his shock, they only point and laugh at him. The fishermen return later and, in broken English, reveal to him that the river gets very low at low tide. To his surprise and embarrassment, he finds he can practically hop across the river at low tide",

Banquo tells Macbeth of King Duncan's pleasure at having been so royally treated. He asks Macbeth if he has been thinking of the weird sisters; Macbeth falsely responds in the negative. Again, he asks Banquo to talk with him at a later date about the strange events of that night.

He sees imaginary drops of blood on the dagger that he will use to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth gives him the signal, and he proceeds towards Duncan's room to kill him",

He was thinking about how Macbeth could decide his own fate to fulfill the witch's prophecy. The couple met Macbeth, who was walking down a corridor. Banquo told Macbeth that King Duncan was very pleased with the way he was being treated like a king. He asked Macbeth if he had thought about the witch; Macbeth deceived him by saying he had never thought about it. He asked Banquo if they could discuss the strange events of that night later; as if Macbeth was seeking a wise and kind friend like Banquo to become a trusted accomplice in the crime.\n\nMacbeth called his wife and was shocked to see her holding a knife, making him frightened. He saw a vision of blood on the knife that he would use to kill Duncan. Macbeth's wife calmed him down, and he went to Duncan's room to kill him.",

Miss Temple invites the two girls to tea in her room. She gives Jane an opportunity to speak in her own defense. Jane gives her an account of her life at Gateshead and mentions the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd. Miss Temple promises to write to him to clear Jane's name. Afterwards, Miss Temple and Helen discuss French and Latin literature at length, and Jane is impressed at Helen's knowledge. But Miss Temple also appears to be greatly concerned about Helen's health. The next day, Miss Scatcherd ridicules Helen Burns by making her wear a label that says 'slattern' on her forehead. Mr. Lloyd replies in a few days confirming Jane's account of her innocence, and Miss Temple communicates this information to the whole school. Jane is relieved and able to concentrate on her studies.",

She must reschedule the picnic because it is rainy and set up everything again the next day. When she goes out to buy lobster, she runs into a friend of Laurie's.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern stepped back, allowing Hamlet to think alone for a while. He compared his useless actions to the brutality of the young Princess Fortinbras and, in desperation, declared: 'No matter the path I choose, I only see / To prove my own absurdity / And to encourage my own delay.' He felt disappointed for having delayed punishing his father, especially when seeing nearly 20,000 brave warriors preparing to leave and sacrifice themselves for a worthless piece of land. From now on, Hamlet decided that his thoughts would 'be lost in blood or useless, nothing matters.'",

In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations.

In Gourville's handwriting, the letter informs Fouquet that a white horse is ready to bear him to safety. The Fouquet destroys the note. Fouquet goes in to see the King. The King asks after his health. Fouquet makes one last attempt to clear his name and defend himself. A little while into their conversation, it is clear Fouquet needs to go to bed. The King summons D'Artagnan to escort the man. Fouquet refuses, saying that a simple footman would do. Once Fouquet leaves, the King orders that D'Artagnan follow him. He asks D'Artagnan to arrest Fouquet, then orders a bunch of draconian measures like a special carriage to prevent notes being thrown out the window. D'Artagnan admits to the King that he tried to save Fouquet, but says that now he will execute his orders. D'Artagnan leaves the King. As he leaves, he sees a very cheerful Gourville heading to Fouquet's lodgings.",
