She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all. After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes",

Initially, when she reads his explanation for his behavior towards Bingley and Jane, she rejects his justification and believes that he acted out of family motives. However, as she reads his explanation for his relationships with Wickham with greater clarity, she begins to understand him better. She soon discovers that she knew nothing about him before he told her about Wickham and himself. She wonders why she didn't notice that it was inappropriate to discuss such things with a stranger. As she continues to read and think, she concludes that she was 'blind, biased, distorting, absurd' and that she believes Darcy's version of events. Then she re-reads the passage about Jane and Bingley and can no longer deny the justice of his description of Jane's obvious irresponsibility. After two hours in the park, she returns home and learns that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy have come to congratulate her on her departure.",

Traddles has discovered that he can recover all of Miss Betsey's money as well as Mr. Wickfield's. Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. Arrangements are made to provide for the Micawbers' debts and raise enough money to get them to Australia. Two days later, Miss Betsey takes David to a hospital and to a funeral.

Mrs. Micawber is concerned that Mr. Micawber should clarify his affairs with his family before the move takes place. Agnes, Traddles, David, and Mrs. Betsy meet to discuss the Micawbers' finances. Traddles discovers that he can claim money from Mrs. Betsy and Mr. Wickfield. Agnes says that she will rent a house and open a school to secure herself and her father financially. David has decided to leave the country. Traddles reports that Uriah has left the city with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. The preparations lead to the Micawbers' debts being called in and enough money being collected to bring them to Australia. Two days later, Mrs. Betsy takes David to a doctor's appointment and attends a funeral. She tells him that her husband has died and that she can no longer harm him.",

An actor dressed in armor comes out on stage and welcomes us to ancient Troy, where the Greeks and Trojans have been going at it on the Trojan battlefields for the last...get this...7 years. Since we're starting out 'in the middle' of all the action, the Prologue quickly catches us up to speed. You know, just in case we've never heard of a little old thing called the Trojan War. Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since. Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.' By the way, Shmooperinos, the Prologue says absolutely NOTHING about Troilus and Cressida, the two characters Shakespeare named this play after. What's up with that?",

Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time.

Mr. Irwine is playing chess with his mother, Mrs. Irwine, a lady of society. Mr. Irwine has decided to remain unmarried in order to be able to care for his mother and his two widowed aunts, rather than founding a family of his own. Joshua Rann, the shoemaker and churchwarden of Hayslope, comes to Mr. Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah, particularly about the carpenter Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made unpleasant remarks about Mr. Irwine and Rann. Mr. Irwine dismisses the complaints and encourages Rann to leave Maskery to his own affairs. As Rann departs, Captain Arthur Donnithorne arrives and asks Mr. Irwine to accompany him on a journey. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landowner, Squire Donnithorne. He is known in the community as 'the young Squire,' a charming man who is recovering from a war injury at the Squire's estate. Rann informs Mr. Irwine and Captain Donnithorne that Thias Bede, Adam Bede's father, has passed away.",

Gaspard, who murdered the Marquis for running down his child, went into hiding for nearly a year after the killing. The French authorities recently captured, jailed, and hanged him, and left his corpse dangling by the village fountain, with his shadow poisoning the atmosphere of the town. Monsieur and Madame Defarge later take the road-mender to Versailles, where the splendor of the court dazzles him. Caught up in the emotion of the experience, the road-mender cheers the King, Queen, and other nobles. The Defarges commend his behavior, feeling that it will fuel the courtiers' arrogance and ignorance of the revolutionary movement. Additionally, the Defarges believe that the sight of such luxury and finery will supply the road-mender with a focus for his hatred and violence in the future.",

Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip.",

Mr. Lorry brought the doctor up to date, but was cautious and restrained in his approach, asking about the triggers for the setbacks and the possibilities of avoiding them. The doctor explained that certain memories had resurfaced since then and that he had anticipated setbacks. He believed that the worst was behind him and doubted whether another setback could occur; if that were the case, it would probably trigger a profound experience that would revive the same memories.\n\nMr. Lorry also inquired about the background of the boxes and materials, but emphasized that their presence had led the doctor back into the past, which had tormented him. The doctor felt uneasy and asked Mr. Lorry to dispose of the box and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry rented the tools and burned the box after the doctor had left, and said that he would meet him with Lucie and Darnay.",

Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle.

The Mock Turtle very proudly lists the various subjects that were taught to him. The subjects include, Reeling and Writhing and the different branches of Arithmetic . Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day. The Mock turtle asserts that it is 'because of this that they are called lessons'.",

Jane's aunt is angry with her, purposely excluding her from the rest of the family, so Jane sits alone in a window seat, reading Bewick's History of British Birds. As she quietly reads, her cousin John torments her, reminding her of her precarious position within the household.

Cedric does not want to entertain these Normans, but his Saxon pride demands that they be offered hospitality; however, he clings to his dignity by refusing to go out to welcome them. Only when they come to him in his hall does Cedric reluctantly welcome them. Cedric counsels Rowena against appearing before the guests. He does not trust the Knight Templar and does not want anything to interfere with his plans to marry Rowena off to the right gentleman. She, however, is keen to hear the latest news from the Holy Land from the Palmer, since she is in love with Ivanhoe, whom she thinks is still fighting in the Crusades.",

However, he is also displeased with the punctual arrival of his nurse, Rowena, for dinner. His thoughts are interrupted by a horn signal. The porter informs him that Prior Aymer from Jorvaulx Abbey, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and a small group of men are on their way to Ashby-de-la-Zouche for the tournament and are requesting accommodation; yet Cedric does not want to receive these Normans, but his Saxon pride demands that he treat them hospitably; at the same time, he maintains his dignity by not offering them personal services. He greets them hesitantly as they enter the house.\n\nCedric advises Rowena to hide from the guests. He does not trust the Templars and wants to do nothing that could jeopardize his plans to marry a respectable lady.

Were it more welcoming, the bank's partners believe, it would lose its status as a respectable business. It is located by Temple Bar, the spot where, until recently, the government displayed the heads of executed criminals. The narrator explains that at this time, 'death was a recipe much in vogue,' used against all manner of criminals, from forgers to horse thieves to counterfeiters. Jerry Cruncher, employed by Tellson's as a runner and messenger, wakes up in his small apartment, located in an unsavory London neighborhood. He begins the day by yelling at his wife for 'praying against' him; he throws his muddy boot at her. Around nine o'clock, Cruncher and his young son camp outside Tellson's Bank, where they await the bankers' instructions. When an indoor messenger calls for a porter, Cruncher takes off to do the job. As young Jerry sits alone, he wonders why his father's fingers always have rust on them",

This news frightens Ellen, and when she goes into Isabella's room, she finds it empty. She does not want to tell Edgar of it then, as he is busy with Catherine.

He sets in motion his plan to steal Edgar's inheritance and when his father enters, he pretends to be distraught over the contents of a letter he has forged, which he tells his father is from Edgar. The letter urges Edmund to join Edgar in a conspiracy against their father where they would assassinate the Earl and split his estate. Gloucester is easily duped by Edmund's story, which is no doubt partly due to the scenes he has witnessed at King Lear's court. Left alone again, Edmund ridicules his father's stupidity. He is joined by Edgar and warns him that his father is in a rage, suggesting that he should carry a sword in order to protect himself. The reason that Edmund gives to Edgar for his father's rage has a supernatural basis. Edmund's clear skills of persuasion also work on Edgar and he believes the story.",

The letter encourages Edmund to join Edgar in a conspiracy against their father, in which they would kill the Earl and divide his property among themselves.

Also since the ship had been traveling on full steam the vessel runs out of coal, as fuel. Fogg nevertheless asks the engineer to run the ship on full steam. He then summons Speedy and pays him enough money to be allowed to burn parts of the ship, in order to use them as fuel. Speedy appreciates the large sum of money and lets Fogg do whatever he wants with the ship. The ship manages to reach Queenstown Harbor and Fogg plans to go to Liverpool from here.

This prompts Maisie to ask whether he's been seeing Mrs. Beale after all. Sir Claude says no, but he's written to her. But, here again, James is hinting at greater intimacy between Maisie's two stepparents. You guessed it: foreshadowing. Shortly after this conversation with Sir Claude, Maisie hears from Mrs. Wix that he has been secretly seeing Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix is convinced of this. Maisie has a hard time accepting that Sir Claude would have lied to her. But soon enough, she gets proof that he has been seeing Mrs. Beale when he takes her to her father's house to see her. Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts. Maisie realizes that this means she won't get to see Mrs. Wix or say goodbye--but only after it's too late.",

This mystery man seems to him just like 'my king's ideal knight,' especially because he followed his conscience above all else and was completely dedicated to one woman. He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was. Even though his position on the throne made him especially vulnerable to criticism, he appears blameless. Who could wish for a better life for his only son, or hope for more for his son's sons than that they resemble such an excellent father--Albert the Good? Now the author addresses the widowed queen, telling her to be strong and endure in the memory of the light they two shared. He ends by saying something along the lines of, 'May Albert's love, the love of her children, and the love of her people surround her until God's love reunites her with her husband again.'",

Banquo tells Macbeth of King Duncan's pleasure at having been so royally treated. He asks Macbeth if he has been thinking of the weird sisters; Macbeth falsely responds in the negative. Again, he asks Banquo to talk with him at a later date about the strange events of that night.

He sees imaginary drops of blood on the dagger that he will use to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth gives him the signal, and he proceeds towards Duncan's room to kill him",

It seems as though Macbeth is searching for a wise and understanding friend like Banquo, who is involved in his criminal plans. Macbeth summons his wife and suddenly finds a dagger in his hand, surprising him. He sees imaginary bloodstains on the knife he will use to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth gives him the signal, and he goes to Duncan's chamber to kill him.",

What a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, but in a fiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so perfectly into my bosom, and bear a burden of my grief, so exactly as my own? Is it not monstrous that a man should be so wretched an object of compassion, and yet should be so obdurate, so unkind, so cruel to himself, as to think there is no such thing as virtue? What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue! What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue! What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue!\n\nHow all occasions do inform against me, and prompt me to a secret but violent indignation.

What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue!\n\nTo be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them. To die, to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pitch and moment, with this regard, their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action. \n\nBut soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

            "text": "The scene begins on a field in Denmark. Prince Fortinbras from Norway marches with his army through Denmark on his way to Poland. Hamlet appears with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and meets a captain who describes the small and worthless stretch in Poland that the young Fortinbras wants to acquire. Hamlet broods over the futility of war, the bloodshed, and the stubborn Poles who will fight to the bitter end for their worthless land. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern leave him, so that Hamlet can have the opportunity to think alone. He compares his inactivity with the aggressive behavior of the young Fortinbras and cries out in despair: 'How all occasions do inform against me, and spur my dull revenge! What is a man? If his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed, a bear, a beast, no more. Is this a noble and most sovereign reason, what is this reason? Why, it is good to be undone, to be not trusted. It is good to be not loved, but to be feared. No, no, no, it is good to be feared, but not to be hated. To be loved is good, to be feared is to be respected, but to be hated is to be despised. Ah, why do I say this? Why do I say this? I am a wretched, miserable, and pitiful worm.

They discuss the likely consequences of Romes premature discovery of their preparations for war. Aufidius is irritated by this development and reproaches the First Senator for not keeping the Volscian preparations a closely guarded secret. When the First Senator denies any knowledge of a military leak, Aufidius produces a letter that he had received four days earlier stating that the Romans have raised an army against the Volscians under the leadership of Cominius, Marcius, and Titus Lartius. The letter also states that the Roman citizens are rebelling. To dispel some of Aufidius anger, the Second Senator makes him a general for the battle. Aufidius closes the scene by commenting that if he and Marcius should meet on the battlefield, there is sure to be a fight to death.",

It discusses the notion of concurrent powers and exclusive powers as they relate to taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both the states and federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",

            "text": "This article examines the tax autonomy of the states and the federal government in the context of administration. It examines the concepts of competing and exclusive sovereignty in relation to administration. Competing sovereignty refers to the joint influence of the states and the federal government. Exclusive sovereignty refers to the power that can only be exercised by the states or the federal government. In the context of administration, the tax autonomy of the federal government vis-à-vis citizens implies that the states can do nothing, as administration is a joint influence. The only limitation of the tax autonomy of the states vis-à-vis citizens are tariffs on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but the states can only levy such taxes with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that joint influence in administration can lead to situations in which states and the federal government tax the same taxpayer, a situation that could be considered 'unfair'. However, Hamilton argues that the Constitution ensures that such situations do not occur. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' if a state and Congress levy the same tax amount.",
