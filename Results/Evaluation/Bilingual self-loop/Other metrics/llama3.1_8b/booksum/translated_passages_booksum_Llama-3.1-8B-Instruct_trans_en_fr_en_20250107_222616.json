When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all. After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes",

The Reverend Irwine is a bachelor who has chosen to care for his mother and his two widowed sisters, one of whom suffers from a chronic illness, rather than starting a family of his own. Joshua Rann, the village cobbler and secretary, comes to see the Reverend Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah. More specifically, Mr. Rann complains about Will Maskery, the turner, who is a Methodist and who has made ironic remarks against the Reverend Irwine and Rann. The Reverend Irwine responds to the insults with irony and asks Rann to leave Maskery in peace. When Rann leaves the house, Captain Arthur Donnithorne arrives to ask the Reverend Irwine to accompany him on horseback. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landowner, Squire Donnithorne. Renowned in the village as the 'young squire', he is a charming man who has come to the Squire's residence to recover from a war wound. Rann tells the Reverend Irwine and Captain Donnithorne about the death of Thias Bede, Adam's father.",

The battle erupts around them, and Christian closes his eyes, dead. Beside Christian's heart, Roxane finds the love letter that Cyrano wrote to Christian for her to give to him. She faints from grief, and Cyrano sends Ragueneau and de Guiche to find and protect her. Carbon emerges from the chaos, twice wounded. But the army has returned, and the men will win if only they can hold on a bit longer. Cyrano tells Carbon not to worry. Now, he has two deaths to avenge: Christian's and his own. Cyrano charges into battle. When he hears a Spanish soldier ask, 'Who are these men who are so eager to die?', he begins to sing the Gascon cadets' song. Cyrano charges into a hail of bullets, singing as he fights.",

Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life. We discover the grim truth behind their relationship: Osmond has gradually gained total control of Isabel, who was once so proud and independent. Isabel and Osmond have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Osmond is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is. She thinks that it is better for him to think that he was wrong all along, although, in fact, he was all too right. Isabel stays up until four in the morning thinking things over. She can't shake off the alarming image of Madame Merle and Osmond in cahoots.",

Isabelle wonders if she presented a false image of herself to Osmond at the beginning of their relationship. Isabelle is convinced that Osmond hates her because she lacks 'tradition.' Well, naturally, it's not that - is he really in love with the originality that is in her? Not only does he despise her opinions and beliefs, but he is also irritated by the way she lives her life. We reveal the dark truth behind their relationship: Osmond has gradually acquired total control over Isabelle, who was once so proud and independent. Isabelle and Osmond have barely exchanged a word with each other. Isabelle knows that Osmond is furious and jealous of Ralph's presence in Rome. Isabelle hasn't told Ralph just how miserable her life is. She thinks it's better for him to think he's wrong, even if in fact he was right. Isabelle stays awake until four in the morning thinking about all this. She can't help but be haunted by the disturbing image of Madame Merle and Osmond working together.",

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death .

However, these entertainments prove to be very different from what one might expect. In fact, it is a common tradition among the Lilliputians who aspire to hold public offices by demonstrating their agility in dancing on a rope, among other things. The length and dexterity with which a candidate can dance on a rope determine the length of their term. Among the candidates, two are particularly talented: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other entertainments include noble competitors who dispute official favors by passing under or jumping over a branch, an exploit for which they are later rewarded with ribbons of different colors. Gulliver inspects the emperor's troops; he keeps his legs apart, while the little men pass over him. Thanks to Gulliver's cooperation, a new treaty is renegotiated between Gulliver and the emperor. Gulliver is granted limited freedom under certain conditions. In exchange for obedience to these conditions, he will receive sufficient provisions for 1,728 Lilliputians. Gulliver swears to the articles in good faith, and the emperor releases him.",

The narrator explains that at this time, 'death was a recipe much in vogue,' used against all manner of criminals, from forgers to horse thieves to counterfeiters. Jerry Cruncher, employed by Tellson's as a runner and messenger, wakes up in his small apartment, located in an unsavory London neighborhood. He begins the day by yelling at his wife for 'praying against' him; he throws his muddy boot at her. Around nine o'clock, Cruncher and his young son camp outside Tellson's Bank, where they await the bankers' instructions. When an indoor messenger calls for a porter, Cruncher takes off to do the job. As young Jerry sits alone, he wonders why his father's fingers always have rust on them",

We find out that Talbot's son has come out to help his father, and they may die together if York and Somerset don't find a way to help. One of the messengers, Sir William Lucy, says the feud between Somerset and York is betraying the memory of Henry V, because it's causing the English to lose what he won. Somerset finally says he'll send some horsemen, but Sir William Lucy fears it will be too late, since they will take six hours to get there. Lucy tells Somerset if Talbot is dead 'His fame lives in the world, his shame in you' , likely meaning that Talbot's courage will be remembered, but that Talbot would have been ashamed of Somerset's behavior.",

It begins with a dialogue between Captain Carbon de Castel-Jaloux and Le Bret, during which they declare that the besieged French troops are ill, depressed, and starving. Since the Spanish troops have cut off their supply lines, the French have nothing to eat. Cyrano seems to be the only one not affected in the tent. He remains awake, even though most of the cadets are sleeping, as he recently infiltrated the Spanish lines to send a letter to Roxane, which he does every day.

Mr. Weston eventually leaves Frank with his brother and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, to raise him, as they had more money and could better support him, and Frank eventually takes on the Churchill surname. Mr. Weston buys a small property in Highbury. He sees his son in London each year, and everyone in Highbury thinks Frank Churchill is one of them, and everyone speaks of him with pride, even though they have never met him. Now that we know Mr. Weston is married to Miss Taylor, everyone thinks he should come, and they soon discover that they need to meet him in order to get to know his new wife better. Instead, Mrs. Weston receives a very pleasant letter from him, which is approved by everyone in Highbury and is constantly discussed.",

He returns to the shore to get his piece of wood, planning to try and float across, but the yard has floated back out to sea. David is now miserable. He begins eating raw shellfish. Sometimes he manages to keep them down, and other times they make him extremely sick. He is especially depressed because he can see a church and several houses on the mainland, but he knows he cannot cross the river. The next day he sees, to his surprise, a red deer, which he realizes must have swum the river. He also discovers that he has lost all his money after the shipwreck. He sees some fisherman, and wildly hails them from the shore. But, to his shock, they only point and laugh at him. The fishermen return later and, in broken English, reveal to him that the river gets very low at low tide. To his surprise and embarrassment, he finds he can practically hop across the river at low tide",

Gratiano frets that they are not well prepared, but Lorenzo assures the men that they have enough time to gather the necessary disguises and torchbearers. As they talk, Launcelot enters bearing Jessica's letter. Lorenzo recognizes the writing, lovingly exclaiming that the hand that penned the message is 'whiter than the paper it writ on'.

Gratiano expresses his concerns about the lack of preparation, but Lorenzo reassures him, saying they have all the time they need to gather the disguises and torches required.\n\nAs they speak, Launcelot enters, carrying Jessica's letter. Lorenzo recognizes the handwriting, exclaiming that the hand that wrote the message is 'whiter than the paper on which it was written.' Lorenzo gives instructions to Launcelot to secretly visit Shylock and console Jessica, telling him that Lorenzo will not abandon her. Launcelot exits the scene, and Lorenzo orders his friends to prepare for the night's festivities. Salarino and Solanio exit the scene, and Lorenzo tells Gratiano that Jessica will escape from Shylock's house by disguising herself as one of the torches. Lorenzo gives the letter to Gratiano and asks him to read it, then exits the scene, excited about the events of the evening.",

He compares his inaction to the aggressive conduct of the young Fortinbras, noting with despair:\n\n'How all occasions do instruct me\nSo ample in themselves,\nA little more than kin, and less than kind,\nWhy was I to be the lord of this fair city, and it pleased not the crown?\nWherein I see more woes than this man\nMight see, were he of my rank,\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nTh' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\nThe pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of th' unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscovered country from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action.\n\n'Send him to me. Let him make no noise in the house.\nHe shall not stand before me. Let him have the\nChoice of the best room next my chamber,\nAnd him to put his to 't before this parliament,\nFor him to speak in support of his demand,\nAnd him to bring me to the test.

            "text": "This paper discusses the powers of the states and the federal government to impose taxes on the people. It discusses the notion of concurrent powers and exclusive powers as they relate to taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both the states and federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.'

            "text": "This study examines the powers of states and the federal government to impose taxes on citizens. It discusses the concept of concurrent powers and exclusive powers in the context of taxation. Concurrent powers are those shared between states and the federal government. Exclusive powers are those that can only be exercised by states or the federal government. In the case of taxation, the federal government's authority to collect taxes cannot prevent state governments from doing the same, as taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction concerning the authority of state governments to collect taxes pertains to tariffs on imports and exports. Congress can collect these taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress.\n\nAlexander Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations where state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that could be 'undesirable.' However, Hamilton argues that the prudence of governments can be counted on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' if a state government and Congress impose the same tax.",
