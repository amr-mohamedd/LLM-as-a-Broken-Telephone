He remembers when he rebelled against his own father, and realizes that his father must have suffered the same pain as he, Siddhartha, suffers now. Sorrows repeat themselves. Still suffering, he returns to the hut and tells Vasudeva of his troubles. Vasudeva, in his silent attentiveness, seems to Siddhartha like a god. They both go and sit by the river bank. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and realizes the unity of all life amidst all its diverse elements. He realizes that in the unity is perfection. His pain disappears as his Self merges with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha no longer fights against his destiny. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen his friend attain enlightenment, announces that he is leaving. He is going to live in the woods and be in the unity of all things.",

Other students felt the punishment was too severe and were planning a protest. That night, people discovered that Susan had escaped through the back door, was drenched in clothes, and was in a state of extreme fear when she arrived at Judah's residence. Judah immediately took her in, provided her with clean clothes and whiskey. Susan was too exhausted to tell Judah her story; she only told it after falling asleep.",

Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since. Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.' By the way, Shmooperinos, the Prologue says absolutely NOTHING about Troilus and Cressida, the two characters Shakespeare named this play after. What's up with that?",

It's a pretty brief summary. The overture then warns us that we may not enjoy this play, because in 'wartime,' nothing good will really happen. By the way, Shmooperinos, the overture doesn't even mention the two characters Shakespeare named in this play: Troilus and Cressida. So what's the problem here?",

            "text": "Hamilton defends the treaty-making procedures outlined in the Constitution. He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making. However, Hamilton responds that this would introduce unnecessary delays and inefficiencies to the process and weaken the American negotiating position.",

He noted that some critics argued that the President should have the power to terminate treaties. Hamilton countered that, unlike European monarchs, the President has a shorter term in office, and even if a treaty is harmful to the country, the President will retire before the end of their term.\n\nTherefore, the President's power must be controlled by the legislative branch. Some people argued that Congress should have more power to sign treaties. However, Hamilton countered that this would lead to unnecessary delays and decreased efficiency, and would also weaken the negotiating power of the American delegation.\n\nHamilton believed that the responsibility for ratifying treaties should be borne by the bicameral government.",

She claims that she has now turned to religion for consolation. She suddenly spots Sue and Little Father Time selling cakes and gingerbread at a stall at the fair. She questions Sue and learns that Jude was very ill that winter, and they have therefore tried their hand at baking in an attempt to earn a living. Sue now has two children of her own and is expecting a third. The cakes Jude makes are shaped like Christminster colleges, with towers and pinnacles and traceried windows, indicating that Jude still has a passion for Christminster.",

Abraham and Anne arrived in Kensington on the same day, and Abraham became a widower. Abraham was deeply saddened and sought solace, walking towards the base of the new church. Abraham claimed that he was now seeking spiritual solace. Suddenly, they saw Sue and a young Chad selling cookies and gingerbread on the street. Abraham asked Sue why she knew Chad was suitable for winter, since they lived in a bakery. Sue was currently a mother of two children and was pregnant with her third child. Chad's cookies were made in the style of the church, including towers, steeples, and colorful stained glass windows, indicating that Chad still deeply loved the church.",

Left-wing lawyer Senek Duro announced his candidacy for mayor and hinted that residents and union supporters should back another candidate. The union nominated Lucas Preti to run for mayor and held multiple rallies in the town. Ultimately, the efforts of Gabache ensured Preti's victory, thereby avoiding a major crisis that the union might have sparked again.\n\nGabache has now become an expert in debate and discussion, invited to various events to promote the town's commercial value and reputation. In his speeches, he discussed several key issues, including whether professors should be fired for holding liberal or socialist ideologies. Gabache's reputation continues to rise in social circles, and he begins to wonder if he has truly experienced the joy of being a responsible citizen.",

He decides that he must see her and is happy that Antonia is not too ashamed to hide her baby from public view. Larry Donovan is a passenger conductor for the railroad and acts like a superior, underappreciated individual. He spends a lot of time getting women to sympathize with his sad plight, and he convinces them that he is much better than he really is. Jim goes to Mrs. Harling and tells her he wants to know about Antonia's aborted marriage. She tells him to go ask the Widow Steavens, who knows the entire story and loves to talk.",

It is a time when many people think they live in the best of times, while others condemn it as the worst of times. The kings of England and France are both mediocre rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People are put to death for the slightest of crimes. The condition in France is very bad, for there is a total disregard for the common people by the aristocracy; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are rampant. The aristocracy is unaware that the masses are preparing for the revolution by turning timber into guillotines and farm carts into tumbrels to convey people to the guillotine. In England, too, lawlessness and poverty prevail. Even the colonies in America are up in arms against their English rulers, and the attempts of the American colonies to obtain freedom are not taken seriously.",

She continues to blame her husband for her unhappiness, not her rabid materialism; everything is someone else's fault, and she is still a creature who is perfectly innocent of blame. She gets a letter from Will, saying that he will be paying a visit sometime soon; Rosamond is cheered up by this, and decides to send out invitations for a dinner party. Of course, all invitations are denied, and Rosamond is still ignorant as to the reason why; she goes to visit her parents, and they tell her the terrible news. When she goes home, she tells her husband that she has heard about everything; she then reiterates that they must go to London, to lessen her suffering. He cannot stand to hear this, and storms out, without taking the time to correct her or explain anything.",

Initially, Francis Pym was interested in Mormonism, but when he found the explanations too dull, he successfully fabricated a few reasons to leave.\n\nThe train arrived at Ogden Station, where a Mormon believer got on, who had just been embroiled in a family dispute. Francis Pym asked him how many wives he had, and he replied that he had only one wife. Francis Pym thought this was different from other Mormon believers, and perhaps better, as multiple wives would bring chaos.",

Jane continues to pay attention to the relationship between St. John and Rosamond, who often visits the school when she knows St. John will be there. Rosamond asks Jane to draw her portrait, and as she is working on it one day, St. John pays her a visit. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. She offers to draw him a duplicate, and then boldly declares that he ought to marry Rosamond. St. John admits that he loves her and is tempted by her beauty, but he explains that he refuses to allow worldly affection to interfere with his holy duties. The flirtatious, silly, and shallow Rosamond would make a terrible wife for a missionary. Suddenly, St. John notices something on the edge of Jane's paper and tears off a tiny piece--Jane is not certain why. With a peculiar look on his face, he hurries from the room",

His grandfather thanked God for allowing them to spend Christmas together. Jim said his grandfather's prayers were special. Then the whole family sat down to enjoy cake and sausages. Jack told them the Smith family was very happy to receive gifts, including Amos.\n\nIn the afternoon, Jack and Jim started playing marbles, Otto was writing a letter to his mother, the Christmas atmosphere was just like last year. At 4 o'clock, Mr. Smith came to their house, wearing a thick woolen coat. He came here to thank them for helping his family. Although he looked comfortable, this comfort was only temporary, because his long-term difficulties had not ended. At 9 o'clock, he left to go back home. Before leaving, he drew a cross on his wife's forehead, calling her a good woman. He also said that good people's prayers are always good.",

Isabel wonders if she gave a false image of herself to Osmond when they first got involved. Isabel feels certain that Osmond hates her, because she doesn't have a sense of 'tradition.' Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life. We discover the grim truth behind their relationship: Osmond has gradually gained total control of Isabel, who was once so proud and independent. Isabel and Osmond have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Osmond is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is. She thinks that it is better for him to think that he was wrong all along, although, in fact, he was all too right. Isabel stays up until four in the morning thinking things over. She can't shake off the alarming image of Madame Merle and Osmond in cahoots.",

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death . A fellow playwright, Thomas Middleton, may have written the snazzy songs in this scene.",

On the other hand, Bulstrode is Lydgates main backer in the town, where he anticipates serious oppositions to his plans for medical reform. Lydgate, therefore, attends the meeting in a confused state. There is heated discussion much of personal, among the members who have earlier assembled. Lydgate comes in last and finds them equally divided. Ultimately, his casting vote is decided by his smarting ego. Mr. Wrench, an old style medical practitioner, declares that it is well known that Lydgate will vote will Bulstrode. Incensed, Lydgate does just that. So Mr. Tyke becomes the hospital chaplain. Farebrother meanwhile, continues to meet Lydgate with the same friendliness as before. But his skepticism and tolerant attitude dont impress Lydgate favorably.",

Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle. The Mock Turtle, sitting on a little rocky ledge, is sad and constantly sighing. Alice requests the Mock Turtle to tell her, his history. The Mock Turtle very proudly lists the various subjects that were taught to him. The subjects include, Reeling and Writhing and the different branches of Arithmetic . Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day. The Mock turtle asserts that it is 'because of this that they are called lessons'.",

How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on. Gulliver is granted limited freedom on certain conditions. In return for abiding by the conditions, he will receive food sufficient for 1,728 Lilliputians.

This journey was unusually perilous, and three passengers were forced to disembark and walk alongside the carriage as it navigated a steep slope through thick fog. Suddenly, a mounted orderly emerged from the mist, demanding to see Mr. Jarvis Lorry of Tidings Bank. The passengers eyed him warily, fearing they might be encountering a highwayman or a bandit. However, Mr. Jarvis Lorry recognized the orderly's voice as Jerry Cruncher, a Tidings Bank porter, and accepted his information. Jerry Cruncher handed Lorry a note that read: 'Wait for Madame Defarge in Dover.' Lorry instructed Jerry Cruncher to return to Tidings Bank and deliver the following reply: 'Resurrection.'

She hovers protectively around her litter, trying to drive White Fang away. When White Fang is three years old, there is a great famine in the land. Only the strong will survive, for the Indians eat the weaker dogs. The Indians also eat the soft-tanned leather of their moccasins and mittens to fill their stomachs. White Fang escapes into the forest to hunt on his own, at times robbing rabbit snares and at times capturing small game, like squirrels and woodmice. At the end of the famine, White Fang meets Lip-lip, with whom he fights until Lip-lip is killed. He then returns to the village and is received warmly and given plenty of fish.",

A crowd of somber, dreary-looking people has gathered outside the door of a prison in seventeenth-century Boston. The building's heavy oak door is studded with iron spikes, and the prison appears to have been constructed to hold dangerous criminals. No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately. This is true of the citizens of Boston, who built their prison some twenty years earlier. The one incongruity in the otherwise drab scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door. The narrator suggests that it offers a reminder of Nature's kindness to the condemned; for his tale, he says, it will provide either a 'sweet moral blossom' or else some relief in the face of unrelenting sorrow and gloom",

He sets in motion his plan to steal Edgar's inheritance and when his father enters, he pretends to be distraught over the contents of a letter he has forged, which he tells his father is from Edgar. The letter urges Edmund to join Edgar in a conspiracy against their father where they would assassinate the Earl and split his estate. Gloucester is easily duped by Edmund's story, which is no doubt partly due to the scenes he has witnessed at King Lear's court. Left alone again, Edmund ridicules his father's stupidity.

Gloucester was easily deceived by Edward's lies, possibly because he had seen similar scenes in the court.\n\nEdward mocked Gloucester's foolishness in front of his father, then met with Gloucester, telling him that his father was extremely angry and advising him to take measures to protect himself. Edward told Gloucester that his father's anger was caused by supernatural reasons.\n\nEdward's persuasive abilities also influenced Gloucester, who began to believe Edward's story.",

This prompts Maisie to ask whether he's been seeing Mrs. Beale after all. Sir Claude says no, but he's written to her. But, here again, James is hinting at greater intimacy between Maisie's two stepparents. You guessed it: foreshadowing. Shortly after this conversation with Sir Claude, Maisie hears from Mrs. Wix that he has been secretly seeing Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix is convinced of this. Maisie has a hard time accepting that Sir Claude would have lied to her. But soon enough, she gets proof that he has been seeing Mrs. Beale when he takes her to her father's house to see her. Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts. Maisie realizes that this means she won't get to see Mrs. Wix or say goodbye--but only after it's too late.",

This mystery man seems to him just like 'my king's ideal knight,' especially because he followed his conscience above all else and was completely dedicated to one woman. He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was. Even though his position on the throne made him especially vulnerable to criticism, he appears blameless. Who could wish for a better life for his only son, or hope for more for his son's sons than that they resemble such an excellent father--Albert the Good? Now the author addresses the widowed queen, telling her to be strong and endure in the memory of the light they two shared. He ends by saying something along the lines of, 'May Albert's love, the love of her children, and the love of her people surround her until God's love reunites her with her husband again.'",

Miss Temple invites the two girls to tea in her room. She gives Jane an opportunity to speak in her own defense. Jane gives her an account of her life at Gateshead and mentions the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd. Miss Temple promises to write to him to clear Jane's name. Afterwards, Miss Temple and Helen discuss French and Latin literature at length, and Jane is impressed at Helen's knowledge. But Miss Temple also appears to be greatly concerned about Helen's health. The next day, Miss Scatcherd ridicules Helen Burns by making her wear a label that says 'slattern' on her forehead. Mr. Lloyd replies in a few days confirming Jane's account of her innocence, and Miss Temple communicates this information to the whole school.

She must reschedule the picnic because it is rainy and set up everything again the next day. When she goes out to buy lobster, she runs into a friend of Laurie's. He sees the lobster, which was considered low-class food at the time, and she is very embarrassed, although she manages to recover and charm him.

Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",

She told Isabella and Heathcliff that Catherine would 'never be what she was' and that Heathcliff should not bother her anymore. Heathcliff asserted that he would not leave her to Edgar's lukewarm care, and that she loved him much more than her husband. He said that if he had been in Edgar's place he would never have interfered with Catherine's friendships, although he would kill the friend the moment Catherine no longer cared about him. Ellen urged Heathcliff to treat Isabella better, and he expressed his scorn and hatred for his wife. He said Isabella knew what he was when she married him: she had seen him hanging her pet dog. Isabella told Ellen that she hated Heathcliff, and he ordered her upstairs so he could talk to Ellen. Alone with her, he told her that if she did not arrange an interview for him with Catherine, he would force his way in armed, and she agreed to give Catherine a letter from him",
