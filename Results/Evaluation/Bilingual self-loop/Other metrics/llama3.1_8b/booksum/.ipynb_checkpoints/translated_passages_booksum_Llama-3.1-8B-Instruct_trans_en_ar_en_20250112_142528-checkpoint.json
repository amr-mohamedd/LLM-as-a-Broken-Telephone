They mock his inferior intellect, criticizing his pronunciation and saying that they abhor 'such rackers of orthography' . Armado, Moth, and Costard enter; Armado tells the learned men that the King has asked him to prepare 'some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antick or firework'  to entertain the Princess and her party. He asks Holofernes and Nathaniel for their help in planning this entertainment, and Holofernes suggests that they present a show of the Nine Worthies. The men discuss who will play the roles of the Worthies, with Holofernes saying that he will play three of the roles himself. They then go off to plan their show.",

When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all. After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes",

St. John did not reply to the letter Jane sent to him regarding the wedding; however, he has since maintained a correspondence with her. Jane goes to see Adele and changes her school for a better and closer one. Jane then tells the reader that it has been ten years now that she has been married as she sits to write about her life. She and Rochester are always together, and after two years, he had regained sight in one of his eyes, enough to see his first-born son. Diana and Mary are both married and come to visit Jane, and she visits them. St. John went to India and is still there. He remained unmarried, and Jane relates that he feels that he will soon die and join God",

The Lord Falstaff ordered Peto to increase his supplies of sack and gave Peto his orders to meet him at the end of the city. He dislikes the idea of his soldiers marching through the city in their tattered clothes. They find themselves in a state of extreme poverty, no one can afford to pay them, just like many others before them, to take advantage of the discharge from military service. In his own words, 'No one has seen men like these.' The Prince of Wales and Westmoreland meet him on the road and comment on the miserable people being led by the Lord Falstaff. The Lord Falstaff remains unmoved and speaks philosophically in the face of these criticisms. Indeed, the Prince of Wales appears more amused than angry. They all need to hurry, says the Prince of Wales, because Percy has already entered the fray. \nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.

The code assumes that the input Arabic text is well-formatted and contains only sentences separated by periods. If the input text has a different format, the code may not work correctly.\n2.  The code uses a dictionary to store the translation rules. If the dictionary is too large, it may consume a lot of memory. In a real-world application, you might want to consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a trie or a database.\n3.  The code does not handle any exceptions that might occur during the translation process, such as a sentence not being found in the translation rules. You might want to add some error handling code to make the function more robust.\n4.  The code does not preserve any context that might be present in the original text.

He remembers when he rebelled against his own father, and realizes that his father must have suffered the same pain as he, Siddhartha, suffers now. Sorrows repeat themselves. Still suffering, he returns to the hut and tells Vasudeva of his troubles. Vasudeva, in his silent attentiveness, seems to Siddhartha like a god. They both go and sit by the river bank. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and realizes the unity of all life amidst all its diverse elements. He realizes that in the unity is perfection. His pain disappears as his Self merges with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha no longer fights against his destiny. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen his friend attain enlightenment, announces that he is leaving. He is going to live in the woods and be in the unity of all things.",

The situation takes a serious turn because a similar incident occurred the year before: a young man had managed to seduce a student of the same college, maintaining that he was her cousin. The mistress inquires about the two photographs on Sue's dressing table. One is of Mr. Phillotson, and the other is of an unknown undergraduate. The next morning, when Sue does return, she is punished and kept in solitary confinement. The other students feel the punishment is too harsh and prepare to protest. In the evening it is discovered that Sue has escaped from a back window. She turns up at Jude's place. She is soaked and shivering with cold. Jude immediately takes her in and offers her some dry clothes and brandy. Sue is so tired that she falls asleep while relating her story.",

A boy tells him it is Christmas Day, and Scrooge realizes that the ghosts visited him all in one night. Scrooge buys a prize turkey and sends it to Bob Cratchit's house. Scrooge dresses in his best clothing and walks in the crowds with a smile. He gives a great deal of money to the portly gentleman who had asked him for a charitable donation yesterday. Scrooge continues to walk through the city and happily talks with everyone he meets. He visits Fred's house and has a wonderful time at the party. The next morning, Scrooge gets to work early. When Cratchit comes in late, Scrooge pretends to reprimand him, then gives him a raise. Scrooge continues his kindly ways, befriending everyone and becoming a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die. He never sees the ghosts again, but he keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart as well as anyone.",

Miss Minchin isn't very nice to Ermengarde, and because of this, Sara feels the need to reach out to her. After lessons, Sara introduces herself. Ermengarde goes on about how clever Sara must be because she can speak French. Sara does what any child would upon making a friend --she asks Ermengarde if she'd like to meet Emily, her doll. When she starts to tell fantastical stories about Emily, Ermengarde is amazed at how she's able to just make things up on the fly. Suddenly, Sara looks like she's in pain. Ermengarde asks her what is up with that, and Sara responds that she's in pain because she misses her father. Then, Ermengarde asks Sara if she'd like to be her best friend. Which is not weird at all. Sara agrees. Yay, BFF!",

Mrs. Micawber is very concerned that Mr. Micawber should repair her relationship with her family before they leave. Agnes, Traddles, David, and Miss Betsey meet to discuss the Micawbers' finances. Traddles has discovered that he can recover all of Miss Betsey's money as well as Mr. Wickfield's. Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. Arrangements are made to provide for the Micawbers' debts and raise enough money to get them to Australia. Two days later, Miss Betsey takes David to a hospital and to a funeral. She tells him that her husband has died, and that he will not be a threat to her anymore",

An actor dressed in armor comes out on stage and welcomes us to ancient Troy, where the Greeks and Trojans have been going at it on the Trojan battlefields for the last...get this...7 years. Since we're starting out 'in the middle' of all the action, the Prologue quickly catches us up to speed. You know, just in case we've never heard of a little old thing called the Trojan War. Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since. Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.' By the way, Shmooperinos, the Prologue says absolutely NOTHING about Troilus and Cressida, the two characters Shakespeare named this play after. What's up with that?",

            "text": "After two years, Judah and Susanna live a lively life, stopping wherever Judah can find work as a stone. However, he refuses to do any religious work. In a small village called Kinnetbridge, they arrive one day. Ariabella is now a widow, and she comes to Kinnetbridge in grief to see the new cathedral being built. She says she returned to faith so that she could be baptized. At that time, Judah and Susanna and their young children discover that selling bread and butter in the bar during the holiday is a good job. Susanna asks about it, and learns that Judah was very ill in the winter, so they tried to prepare bread in an attempt to survive. Now, Susanna gives birth to two children of her own and is expecting a third child. Judah makes bread in the shape of the Christian church, with towers and a surrounding wall and visible windows, indicating that Judah still loves the Christian church. \nNote: The translation is provided as is, without any modifications or corrections.

The function uses a dictionary `translation_rules` to map Arabic words to their English translations. It then splits the input text into words, checks each word against the translation rules, and appends the translated word to a list if a rule is found. Finally, it joins the translated words back into a string and returns the result. The code includes a test case to demonstrate the function's usage. \n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the translated text: 'In 2015, the \\'International Center for Education and Training\\' project was launched, aiming to promote cooperation between universities and international organizations, and to promote development and progress in the field of education and training.\\'. \n\nNote that this is a simple implementation and may not cover all possible edge cases or nuances of the Arabic language.

He tosses the grief-stricken father a coin and Defarge emerges from the crowd to comfort Gaspard. He throws the coin back into the carriage as it speeds away.

They have to move the walker fast, so Deryn runs back to the chain and tries to cut the sleigh free. She manages to free the sleigh, but the momentum starts the sleigh down the slope toward the walker. Riding the sleigh, Deryn yells for Dr. Barlow, who comes out and realizes what's happening. Deryn rides the sleigh toward the walker, hoping the two don't collide with her in the middle. Dr. Barlow throws out the ladder from the walker's belly, indicating that Deryn should grab it and climb aboard. As she passes the walker, Deryn leaps for the ladder, catches it, and Bauer and Hoffman help her aboard.",

That means that Babbitt and his pro-business brotherhood need to fire up their election machine and get anyone other than Doane into office. They promote a candidate named Lucas Prout and Babbitt goes around giving speeches in support of Prout. Ultimately, Babbitt's efforts are able to get Lucas Prout elected mayor. The business community survives another big scare from organized labor. Now that he has an established reputation as a speechmaker, Babbitt is invited to all sorts of functions to give speeches about business and about the glory of Zenith. One of the main points in his speeches is that state universities should fire all professors who preach liberal or socialist views. As his star continues to rise in Zenith's social circles, Babbitt wonders how he ever could have doubted the joys of being a solid citizen.",

But on Easter Monday he gets a message from Mrs. Edlin saying that his aunt's health is sinking. Jude rushes to Marygreen to find Aunt Drusilla already dead. He informs Sue, who arrives for the funeral. After the funeral, Sue and Jude have a discussion about Aunt Drusilla's disapproval of marriage for the Fawleys. Sue confesses to an intense physical aversion to Phillotson, although she respects and likes him as a friend. Jude senses her unhappiness and laments the fact that he did not try to prevent her hasty marriage. Sue will not let Jude comfort her and goes off to Widow Edlin's cottage for the night. Later that night, Jude hears the cry of trapped rabbit, and, unable to bear it, he goes out and relieves it of further pain by putting it to death. He finds Sue awake at her window, and she breaks down and pours out all her suffering to him. She finally admits her mistake in not considering the full implications of marriage.",

Although he is coolly polite, the Marquis' dislike for his nephew is apparent. Darnay equally despises his uncle, and the fear and hatred inspired by the Evremond name troubles him. Before they part, the Marquis asks about Darnay's relationship with Doctor Manette and Lucie and then smiles mysteriously.

Amidst the chaos, a young woman stood out, her bright blue eyes shining like stars in the darkness. She was a stranger in the city, but she moved with a confidence that belied her inexperience. As she walked, the crowds parted around her, and the vendors called out to her, offering her their wares. The woman's eyes scanned the stalls, taking in the vibrant colors and exotic scents of the market.

Mr. Irwine is playing chess with his mother, Mrs. Irwine, a socialite. Mr. Irwine is a bachelor because he has chosen to take care of his mother and two unmarried sisters, one of whom is chronically ill, rather than have his own family. Joshua Rann, the cobbler and parish clerk of Hayslope, comes to see Mr. Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah. In particular, Mr. Rann complains about the wheelwright, Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made disparaging remarks about Mr. Irwine and Rann. Mr. Irwine laughs off the insults and tells Rann to leave Maskery to his own business. As Rann is leaving, Captain Arthur Donnithorne arrives to ask Mr. Irwine to go riding with him. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landlord, Squire Donnithorne.

In the garret where Doctor Alexandre Manette stayed, Defarge and Jacques One, Two, and Three listen to the road-mender describe what happened to Gaspard, the man who killed the Marquis. Gaspard, who murdered the Marquis for running down his child, went into hiding for nearly a year after the killing. The French authorities recently captured, jailed, and hanged him, and left his corpse dangling by the village fountain, with his shadow poisoning the atmosphere of the town. Monsieur and Madame Defarge later take the road-mender to Versailles, where the splendor of the court dazzles him. Caught up in the emotion of the experience, the road-mender cheers the King, Queen, and other nobles. The Defarges commend his behavior, feeling that it will fuel the courtiers' arrogance and ignorance of the revolutionary movement. Additionally, the Defarges believe that the sight of such luxury and finery will supply the road-mender with a focus for his hatred and violence in the future.",

He works as an agent for the standard Oil Company, but he can accost anyone on the road and rapidly begin shooting words at him. He is a terror for the Winesburg citizens. But when Joe organizes the baseball club, he is considered a savior, as he can channel his ideas and excitement into the players and make them win. Joe falls in love with Sarah king a lean, sad-looking woman. Her brother Tom is considered dangerous, and so is his father Edward, the people of Winesburg can't help laughing at the odd pair but are afraid for Joe. George Willard reports his meeting with the two Kings. Apparently, Joe has managed to sweep away the two, by his torrent of words and ideas. His ideas have managed to perplex the two men and have given them no chance to counter attack Joe.",

He works as an agent for Standard Oil, but he can meet anyone on the road and start quickly to unleash his words on him. He is a source of fear for the people of Winburg. But when Joe establishes a baseball club, he is a leader, where he can direct his thoughts and his passion to the players and win them. Joe falls in love with Sarah King, a thin and tired-looking woman. Her brother Tom is considered dangerous, as well as her father Edward, people from Winburg can only laugh at the strange couple, but they are afraid of Joe. George Willard reports on his meeting with the couple. It seems that Joe has managed to eliminate the couple, with his words and thoughts. His thoughts have managed to impress the couple and given them a chance to respond to Joe. \nNote: The translation is not perfect, but it is the best possible translation given the context and the original text.

It is a time when many people think they live in the best of times, while others condemn it as the worst of times. The kings of England and France are both mediocre rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People are put to death for the slightest of crimes. The condition in France is very bad, for there is a total disregard for the common people by the aristocracy; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are rampant. The aristocracy is unaware that the masses are preparing for the revolution by turning timber into guillotines and farm carts into tumbrels to convey people to the guillotine. In England, too, lawlessness and poverty prevail. Even the colonies in America are up in arms against their English rulers, and the attempts of the American colonies to obtain freedom are not taken seriously.",

He and the stranger have a discussion about Dinah, and Mr. Casson says he believes it is inappropriate for a woman to preach on the village green. As Dinah begins to preach, she draws in the villagers with her soft, loving voice, and the stranger stays to listen to her despite his reservations about a woman preacher. Dinah's sermon tells about the love Jesus has for the poor and encourages the townspeople to give up their sins and do good in the world. The villagers accept her slowly, and by the time she concludes her preaching, many of them are moved to tears",

Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip.",

And at least then, he says, he could respect himself. Also, at least he would have certainty. If someone asked what he was, the answer would be clear: a lazy person! For example: the Underground Man once knew a guy who was a connoisseur of Lafitte . That was pretty much the guy's only defining feature, but at least he had a defining feature. So he died a happy man. The point is that the Underground Man has no such vocation. If he could pick something to be, he'd pick...mmm...a glutton . A glutton who can appreciate 'everything sublime and beautiful.' The more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that should have been what his life was about: appreciating the sublime and beautiful. He realizes that such a life would probably have meant a lot of crying. Any time someone did anything beautiful or sublime, he would have wept in awe.

I changed 'رجل تحت الأرض' to 'a man underground' to make it clearer that the man is not just physically underground, but also emotionally or spiritually. I also changed 'شخص عطشان' to 'a glutton' to make it clearer that the person is someone who has a big appetite for life, not just for food. Let me know if you want me to make any further changes. \n\nHere is the final translation:\n\nWhen a man underground wants to be a permanent state of inaction simply because of his inability, it would be easy. At least, as he says, he would be able to sympathize with himself. He would at least be certain of himself. If someone asked him what he was, the answer would be clear: an incapacitated person! For example, he knew a man who was a connoisseur of fine wines. This was the only quality he could describe him with, but at least he had a quality. A man had died happy.

She establishes a routine in their new home, and she keeps herself hopeful by setting aside a chair or books for her husband and otherwise behaving as if he lived there, too. Her father informs her that there is a place that she can stand on the sidewalk during certain hours which is overlooked by a window in the prison which her husband may sometimes look out. Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks. He notices that she is there every day, and he mocks her for knowing someone in the prison, pretending to guillotine the whole family with his saw. During December, a crowd of five hundred including Jacques Four and the Vengeance descend on Lucie while she is walking near the prison. She is frightened, but her father reassures her that they will not harm her. Madame Defarge walks by and salutes them. Charles is summoned to appear in court the next day",

As earlier planned, Hamlet arrives with Horatio and Marcellus, just before midnight in order to watch for the Ghost. While they are speaking to one another, a flourish of trumpets and canon fire is heard in the distance. Hamlet explains in disgust that this is a sign that the new King, his uncle and stepfather, is engaged in his customary drunken revelry. Suddenly the ghost appears. Hamlet addresses the apparition as 'King, father; royal Dane' and implores it to reveal the reason for its nocturnal wanderings. The ghost simply beckons Hamlet to follow it to another place. Horatio and Marcellus beg Hamlet not to obey the ghost, fearing it would be dangerous and could even lead to his death; but Hamlet ignores his friends' warnings, breaks away from them when they try to physically restrain him, and follows the Ghost. Horatio and Marcellus are convinced that 'something is rotten in the state of Denmark' and decide to follow Hamlet.",

Isabel wonders if she gave a false image of herself to Osmond when they first got involved. Isabel feels certain that Osmond hates her, because she doesn't have a sense of 'tradition.' Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life. We discover the grim truth behind their relationship: Osmond has gradually gained total control of Isabel, who was once so proud and independent. Isabel and Osmond have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Osmond is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is. She thinks that it is better for him to think that he was wrong all along, although, in fact, he was all too right. Isabel stays up until four in the morning thinking things over. She can't shake off the alarming image of Madame Merle and Osmond in cahoots.",

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death . A fellow playwright, Thomas Middleton, may have written the snazzy songs in this scene.",

Additionally, the translation uses the phrase 'آمنت بروس باين' which means 'I believed in Rose Byrne' but it is unclear what this means in the context of the original text.  A more accurate translation may be 'I trusted Rose Byrne' or 'I believed Rose Byrne'.  However, without further context, it is difficult to provide a more accurate translation.  It is recommended to review the original text and provide a more accurate translation based on the context and meaning of the original text.
