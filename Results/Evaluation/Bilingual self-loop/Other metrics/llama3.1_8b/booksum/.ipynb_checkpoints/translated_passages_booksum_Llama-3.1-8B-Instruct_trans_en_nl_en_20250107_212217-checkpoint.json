When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.

Mrs. Micawber is very concerned that Mr. Micawber should repair her relationship with her family before they leave. Agnes, Traddles, David, and Miss Betsey meet to discuss the Micawbers' finances. Traddles has discovered that he can recover all of Miss Betsey's money as well as Mr. Wickfield's. Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. Arrangements are made to provide for the Micawbers' debts and raise enough money to get them to Australia. Two days later, Miss Betsey takes David to a hospital and to a funeral. She tells him that her husband has died, and that he will not be a threat to her anymore",
