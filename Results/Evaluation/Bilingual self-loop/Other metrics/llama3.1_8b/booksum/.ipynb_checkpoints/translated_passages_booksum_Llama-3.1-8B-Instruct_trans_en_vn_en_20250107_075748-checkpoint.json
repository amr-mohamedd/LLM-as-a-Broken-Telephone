When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.

When she read about the reasons behind his actions in his relationship with Bingley and Jane, she initially refused to accept the reasons for his interest in Jane, considering them insignificant and believing that he acted out of concern for her family. However, when she began reading about the reasons behind his actions in his relationship with Wickham, she started to read them more clearly. She quickly realized that she knew very little about Wickham before he spoke about him and Darcy, and wondered why she hadn't noticed the inconsistency in his words when speaking to strangers. Continuing to read and reflect, she realized that she was 'blind, biased, one-sided, and lacking in compassion,' and believed that Darcy's reasons were correct. After a two-hour walk in the park, she returned home and found that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to bid her farewell.",
