When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all. After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes",

Initially, when she reads his explanation for his behavior towards Bingley and Jane, she rejects his justification and believes that he acted out of family motives. However, as she reads his explanation for his relationships with Wickham with greater clarity, she begins to understand him better. She soon discovers that she knew nothing about him before he told her about Wickham and himself. She wonders why she didn't notice that it was inappropriate to discuss such things with a stranger. As she continues to read and think, she concludes that she was 'blind, biased, distorting, absurd' and that she believes Darcy's version of events. Then she re-reads the passage about Jane and Bingley and can no longer deny the justice of his description of Jane's obvious irresponsibility. After two hours in the park, she returns home and learns that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy have come to congratulate her on her departure.",

As Cunegonde resists her attacker, a Captain arrives and kills him because he had insulted an officer. The Captain makes Cunegonde his maid and holds her captive for three months before selling her to a Jewish merchant. The merchant shares her services with the same Inquisitor who caused Pangloss' death and mistreated Candide. Cunegonde successfully resists the advances of both men. Cunegonde participates in the executions following the earthquake and recognizes Candide. Cunegonde's story is now over. At this moment, Candide and Cunegonde are eating together and spending time with each other, until one of their owners, the merchant Don Issachar, appears and kidnaps them.",
