When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family. However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.

Since we're starting out 'in the middle' of all the action, the Prologue quickly catches us up to speed. You know, just in case we've never heard of a little old thing called the Trojan War. Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since. Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.' By the way, Shmooperinos, the Prologue says absolutely NOTHING about Troilus and Cressida, the two characters Shakespeare named this play after. What's up with that?",

Pastor Irwine is playing chess with his mother, the respectable Mrs. Irwine. Pastor Irwine remained unmarried in order to care for his mother and his two older aunts, one of whom is chronically ill, rather than establishing his own family. The shoemaker and churchwarden of Hayslope, Joshua Rann, visits Pastor Irwine to complain about the Methodists and Dinah, particularly about the carpenter, Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has spoken inappropriately about Pastor Irwine and Rann. Pastor Irwine pretends not to have heard anything and tells Rann to leave Maskery alone. After Rann has left, Captain Arthur Donnithorne visits Pastor Irwine to invite him. Captain Donnithorne is the grandson and heir of the local landowner, Mr. Donnithorne. In the community, he is referred to as 'the young gentleman', a handsome man who is recovering from a war wound. Rann shares the news with both Pastor Irwine and Captain Donnithorne that Thias Bede, Adam's father, has passed away.",

Gaspard, who murdered the Marquis for running down his child, went into hiding for nearly a year after the killing. The French authorities recently captured, jailed, and hanged him, and left his corpse dangling by the village fountain, with his shadow poisoning the atmosphere of the town.

Caught up in the emotion of the experience, the road-mender cheers the King, Queen, and other nobles.

Decius goes on to suggest that the Senate will ridicule Caesar for being governed by his wife's dreams. Caesar changes his mind and goes to the Capitol.

Decius continues with the suggestion that the Senate will laugh at Caesar's smile because he is influenced by his wife's dreams. Caesar changes his mind and goes to the Capitol. Caesar arrives and greets Antony, who is sick from the aftermath of the previous night's festivities.",

Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip.",

Her father informs her that there is a place that she can stand on the sidewalk during certain hours which is overlooked by a window in the prison which her husband may sometimes look out. Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks. He notices that she is there every day, and he mocks her for knowing someone in the prison, pretending to guillotine the whole family with his saw. During December, a crowd of five hundred including Jacques Four and the Vengeance descend on Lucie while she is walking near the prison. She is frightened, but her father reassures her that they will not harm her. Madame Defarge walks by and salutes them. Charles is summoned to appear in court the next day",

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death .

            "text": "The witches have now gathered in an open field with Hecate, the goddess of the witches, who seems a bit irritated. Hecate delivers a long, galloping monologue, a bit like a nursery rhyme, to the mysterious sisters. She is extremely irritated that they have intervened in Macbeth's affairs without her permission, and that they should have done so. She also points out that Macbeth has no respect for them, but only for himself. However, Hecate will resolve this conflict. She gives them all instructions to return the next morning, when Macbeth will learn his fate, whatever it may be.\n\nAfter this follows a lively witches' song and dance, and everyone departs after Hecate.\n\nSome literary critics believe that this scene is too childish to have been written by Shakespeare, so it must have been added during the writing and publication of the first folio, which took place after his death. A fellow dramatist, Thomas Middleton, is probably responsible for writing the quick songs in this scene.",

His personal preference is for Farebrother, who has a humane touch and who has been serving as chaplain all along without pay. Now that the post is an earned one, it seems unfair to deprive him. On the other hand, Bulstrode is Lydgates main backer in the town, where he anticipates serious oppositions to his plans for medical reform. Lydgate, therefore, attends the meeting in a confused state. There is heated discussion much of personal, among the members who have earlier assembled. Lydgate comes in last and finds them equally divided. Ultimately, his casting vote is decided by his smarting ego. Mr. Wrench, an old style medical practitioner, declares that it is well known that Lydgate will vote will Bulstrode. Incensed, Lydgate does just that. So Mr. Tyke becomes the hospital chaplain. Farebrother meanwhile, continues to meet Lydgate with the same friendliness as before. But his skepticism and tolerant attitude dont impress Lydgate favorably.",

Since she is afraid of the Queen, the Duchess eventually departs, and Alice is now encouraged by the King to meet the Sheep. The King orders the Gryphon to take Alice to meet the Sheep. The Sheep, sitting on a small rock, is melancholic and sighs continuously. Alice asks the Sheep to tell her its story. The Sheep gives her a list of the various subjects it has studied with pride. The subjects include anger and wrinkles and the different branches of arithmetic. Mysterium, the geography of the sea, drawing, stretching, and Flutterbys were also included. What Alice finds interesting about the Sheep's school is that the length of the visits would decrease every day. The Sheep says that 'this is the reason why lessons are called lessons'.",

White Fang escapes into the forest to hunt on his own, at times robbing rabbit snares and at times capturing small game, like squirrels and woodmice. At the end of the famine, White Fang meets Lip-lip, with whom he fights until Lip-lip is killed. He then returns to the village and is received warmly and given plenty of fish.",

She realizes they are totally mismatched and decides she will not marry until she finds someone with whom she can have a proper and supportive relationship.

Mr. Bennet keeps his distance, as usual, and takes no stance. Elizabeth, who is still pondering the contents of Darcy's letter, has never had a more heated argument with her parents over their behavior. She decides that she will only marry someone she finds acceptable and with whom she can have a respectable and supportive marriage.\n\nIn contrast to the dull Kitty and her mother, Elizabeth looks forward to her trip with the Gardiners. While dreaming of the northern tour, she receives a letter stating that the trip must be shortened to only Derbyshire. She is a bit disappointed, as she had expected more. The Gardiners take Elizabeth to Lambton, where Miss Gardiner used to live. Pemberley, Darcy's estate, is approximately five kilometers further away. Elizabeth is convinced by her aunt and uncle to visit Pemberley, as the family is not there.",

A light breakfast is enjoyed and then pipes are smoked. After breakfast, people tend to whatever they like. Tinor inspects her cloth and food supplies; Marheyo works on his hut; the girls adorn their hair and skin with oils. The narrator usually wanders with Kory-Kory or else sits inside. Then they enjoy a midday nap. Usually in the afternoon, the narrator goes to the Ti, where Mehevi and the other chiefs gather. Since women are not allowed in the Ti, it resembles a happy bachelor pad where the best food can be found and where the men sit around smoking and talking. After night falls, a light evening meal of 'poee-poee,' cooked breadfruit, is eaten. Native girls often dance around their huts under the moonlight. Everyone then sleeps.

Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'. Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's pride if he had not affronted hers.

In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.'

She told Isabella and Heathcliff that Catherine would 'never be what she was' and that Heathcliff should not bother her anymore. Heathcliff asserted that he would not leave her to Edgar's lukewarm care, and that she loved him much more than her husband. He said that if he had been in Edgar's place he would never have interfered with Catherine's friendships, although he would kill the friend the moment Catherine no longer cared about him. Ellen urged Heathcliff to treat Isabella better, and he expressed his scorn and hatred for his wife. He said Isabella knew what he was when she married him: she had seen him hanging her pet dog. Isabella told Ellen that she hated Heathcliff, and he ordered her upstairs so he could talk to Ellen. Alone with her, he told her that if she did not arrange an interview for him with Catherine, he would force his way in armed, and she agreed to give Catherine a letter from him",
