The film is a spin-off of the zombie film series, inspired by Irish folklore stories about the dead.\n\nThe story revolves around a group of Irish-American men who return to their ancestral homeland of Ireland, only to find that their family island is under siege by zombies. The title is a satirical take on Herbert Spencer's concept of 'Survival of the Fittest,' which was first proposed in 1864.\n\nThe film stars Kenneth Welsh, Gavin Fitzgibbon, and Alison Louder, combining horror and comedy elements. It premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival to generally positive reviews.\n\nThe film explores the themes of survival in a zombie-infested world and the importance of family.
