They can be found in many common household items from bicarbonate of soda to drain cleaner.\n\nBut not all of these substances are harmful to human health - it depends how strong they are.\n\nWeak alkalis are unlikely to cause any harm. In fact they can be consumed - such as baking soda in cakes.\n\nIt is products that contain strong alkalis like sodium hydroxide that cause damage , these are most commonly used in strong household cleaners and the paper industry.\n\nA common misconception is that is it only acids which are corrosive, but strong alkalis like this can also cause serious damage to humans.\n\nDepending on how long you are exposed, the type of exposure (ingestion or skin contact) and the dose it can cause severe burns to tissue, accumulation of fluid in the lungs and blindness.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

It predates the time of the Biblical King David and King Solomon and is characteristic of the Canaan region on the eastern Mediterranean coast.",

The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent. Only later did it admit that for the first time ever China had fired ballistic missiles over the top of the island, into the Pacific Ocean.",

            "text": "Several newspapers have highlighted the early release of prisoners in England and Wales. The Daily Telegraph presents a photo of a visibly tattooed suspect making a head gesture in front of Durham Prison, accompanied by the caption: 'Hello, Keir.' The magazine illustrator, Matt, tackles the issue of reintegration by showing prisoners leaving prison under a sign that reads: 'Thanks for staying. We'll see you soon.'\n\nOn the Daily Mail cover, a photo shows a prisoner from Nottingham Prison being sprayed with champagne outside - described in the subtitle as 'unacceptable celebrations.' The magazine lists other incidents it condemns, including a suspect who is 'greeted by friends in a Lamborghini' and another who has pledged to become 'long-term enemies of the Labour opposition.'\n\nThe Sun condemns the release plan as 'a day of shame for the justice system.' However, its editorial acknowledges that the circumstances leading to this are 'not the fault of the new government.' It notes that overcrowding dates back to the time of Tony Blair.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

The 36-year-old American won by unanimous decision at the BMO Stadium to extend his unbeaten record to 41 fights. A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",
