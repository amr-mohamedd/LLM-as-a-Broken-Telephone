Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast.

They stormed the coast from dark dunes. Some young men turned against the police and confronted them, hitting them with long sticks, setting off fireworks or similar objects. Two childless women were arrested by the police on the Boulevard de la Promenade. One of them said she came from Iraq and had desperately tried to reach Britain to see her family again. As soon as the migrants boarded the inflated rescue boat, which had been pulled over the sand, the police did not pursue them anymore. It seemed as if the overcrowded rescue boat would remain on the sandbars when the water receded, but then it set course for open sea. We waited until the light grew stronger and saw that several small rescue boats had been released by a large French rescue ship nearby. The rescue boats seemed to be gathering around the rescue boat, which was now far away. It didn't take long before it became apparent that there were injured people on the rescue boat.",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

If the craft touches down gently on the lunar surface, it will be the first American mission to do so since the famed Apollo missions in the 1960s/70s.\n\nThe Vulcan left Cape Canaveral at 07:18 GMT (02:18 EST). The Peregrine lander is expected to attempt its landing on 23 February.\n\nJust hours after launch, Astrobotic, the company behind the Moon mission, said the spacecraft ran into a technical hitch involving its solar panels.\n\nAstrobotic said engineers were working on the issue and would provide updates when it had more information.\n\nIn the future, the Vulcan rocket will be launching many of America's national security missions.",

            "text": "There are many millions of households for whom normal growth will not feel good.\n\nWhen I go around the country and ask people about recession ending, there is a mixture of resignation, laughter and annoyance.\n\nThe significant hike in the level of prices is what households notice the most, more than the rate of inflation or GDP. While per capita GDP is now also up for the first time in two years, it is still lower now than two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turning point? Or will they focus on years of sluggish growth and declining living standards before that?\n\nThe economic hangover from the worst health crisis in a century and the worst energy crisis in a generation was always going to be tough, but the economy now appears to be returning to normal. If sustained, that is a marked improvement.\n\nAnd with that, we're closing our live coverage.

The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent.

Attempts to separate the primates and rescue Rene were unsuccessful. Just a week earlier, another gorilla was injured and required surgery. A zoo spokesperson said: 'Such behaviors are particularly common in the wild during mating season, especially when females are in heat and males fight for dominance in the troop.'\n\nAnother gorilla named Qafzeh was injured and had to return to the troop after recovering. He was gradually reintroduced to the group. The zoo spokesperson added: 'Rene was a giant and will be missed by all who cared for him.'

The leisure park said that the rollercoaster will be accessible to visitors again on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia reaches a height of 236 feet (72 m) and has a top speed of 81 miles per hour (130 km/h). The leisure park said that the shutdown followed 'standard technical inspections prior to opening,' but provided no further details.\n\n'A huge thank you to everyone for their patience and understanding,' said a Thorpe Park spokesperson. The leisure park had already told visitors that it was not possible to reopen Hyperia before 8 June and last week added that it was not possible to open the rollercoaster on the planned date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, X or send us your article ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk or send us a WhatsApp message to 08081 002250.",

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

In this way, they are saving themselves after days of explanations, in which they had promised that even the slightest Israeli step would be severely punished.\n\nMany had predicted that Israel would wait until after the Passover holiday to react, but it seems that it has decided to act early and send a clearer signal before the holiday. It could be attacked at another location with varying intensity.\n\nAs my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis illustrates exactly how poorly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis could be a wake-up call for all whose hearts beat for the province of Isfahan, with its impressive Islamic architecture, but also for a place where targets for nuclear attacks lie, an important factor for the air force, a large industrial area that also includes the production of weapons and missile defense factories.\n\nThis round is over for the moment, but the simmering hatred between the two regional enemies is far from over.",
