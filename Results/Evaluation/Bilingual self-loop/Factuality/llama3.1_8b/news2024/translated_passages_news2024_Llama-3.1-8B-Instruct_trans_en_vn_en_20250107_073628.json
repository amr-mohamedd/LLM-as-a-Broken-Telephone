Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

Knox's lawyer said they had 'fully cooperated with authorities.'\n\nBoth drivers were lightly injured and treated at the scene, while the driver of the other vehicle was taken to a local hospital.\n\nRice was drafted into the NFL in 2023 and participated in the Kansas City Chiefs' consecutive Super Bowl wins in February.",

            "text": "A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting her twice in 1975 when she was 17.\n\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nMs Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.\n\nThe judge decided the case did not qualify for a two-year window for submitting claims that would otherwise fall outside the usual legal time limit, because Tyler's alleged conduct did not meet the criteria for posing a 'serious risk of physical injury'.\n\nTyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: 'We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.'\n\nThe singer has also denied claims in a separate continuing case filed by another woman in 2022.",

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient.

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

In this context, national leaders have described it as a weak attack, with the perpetrator still unclear. They have no problem saying that even the smallest Israeli incursions will trigger a strong reaction from Tehran.\n\nMany have predicted that Israel will wait until Easter Sunday to retaliate. However, it appears they have decided to strike earlier, to send a clear signal, just before the holidays begin. There may be another attack, at a different location, with a different force, when this phase ends.\n\nHowever, as colleague Jeremy Bowen wrote, this crisis has shed light on the deep misunderstanding between Iran and Israel.\n\nThis may be just a warning shot in Iran, the city of Isfahan with its impressive Islamic architecture, but also a nuclear facility, a large airport, and a complex industrial zone including drone and missile production plants.\n\nThis phase may have ended, at least temporarily, but the hatred between these enemies in this region will take time to cool down.\n\nLearn more: 'Israel attacks Iran'",

We’ve got a Labour government!” A delighted member of the Cabinet told me reality only finally hit them when driving through their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters sent the Tories packing.\n\nIn the prime minister’s first seven days he’s been confronted with a deeply awkward situation abroad – President Joe Biden’s competence dominating the NATO summit.\n\nAt home the justice secretary has felt compelled to plan early prisoner releases (it’s unusual a politician would make a willing choice to do that), and doubts over the survival of the steel plant in Port Talbot linger.\n\nIn other words, Labour is already grappling with the tasks government requires them to do – not the options they would choose.\n\nBut on Wednesday their own plans will take centre stage, with all the fuss and fanfare Westminster can summon – the attendance of the King, the giant golden throne (yes, really!), the trumpets, the frills and flounces.\n\nThe first ‘King’s Speech’ will list the law the government hopes to pass in its first year of what Labour already hopes will be a decade in charge.",
