Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said that he is optimistic about maintaining a 5.25% interest rate (the highest level in 16 years) because it is the sixth time maintaining such a high rate. Bailey said that the Bank of England expects the inflation rate (measuring the speed of price rises) to approach its 2% target in a few months, which makes it possible to cut interest rates in the summer or even in June.

People's reactions to the economic downturn are filled with despair, humor, and dissatisfaction with the current situation.\n\nWhat's most worrisome is that prices are rising rapidly, rather than inflation rates or GDP. Although the average GDP production level is higher than last year's, it still lags behind the production level two years ago.\n\nWill people welcome economic reforms or continue to focus on the downturn and declining living standards? The economic consequences of the most severe health crisis of this century and the most severe energy crisis of this generation are unsustainable, but the economy seems to be gradually recovering to normal. If this trend continues, things will get better.\n\nWe will provide more information at the end of the program. If you need more information, please refer to our news coverage.\n\nThis article has been reviewed by Emily McGarvey and Aoife Walsh. The article was written by Dearbail Jordan, Ali Abbas Ahmadi, Sophie Abdulla, and James Harness. Thank you for sharing with us.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

The first two of these characteristics are strengths of Red Bull, the last Ferrari.\n\nMcLaren expect the next couple of circuits in Mexico and Brazil to be better for them than Austin.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

            "text": "A witness examination can often play out like a game of chess: early moves will eventually set up a bigger play later.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass started off today by asking David Pecker about the times he’d personally witnessed Trump running his business.\n\nSteinglass asked Pecker to describe Trump as a businessman. “Very knowledgeable, very detail oriented, almost a micro-manager,” Pecker replied.\n\nAnd what was his approach to money like? “Frugal”, Pecker replies.\n\nWhile this might seem flattering, prosecutors are likely trying to establish that Trump ran his business meticulously and was aware of how the Trump Organization spent his money.\n\nSteinglass also asks if he ever saw Trump signing cheques, and if they were ever attached to invoices with staples or other means.\n\nPecker replied that he had watched Trump reviewing invoices and signing cheques, and recalled the corresponding items were often stapled together.\n\nThat detail might help prosecutors argue their claim that Trump in fact knew about the allegedly fraudulent way Michael Cohen was repaid for fronting the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nOn Monday, Trump’s lawyer asserted that the former president would not have had knowledge of that accounting process.",
