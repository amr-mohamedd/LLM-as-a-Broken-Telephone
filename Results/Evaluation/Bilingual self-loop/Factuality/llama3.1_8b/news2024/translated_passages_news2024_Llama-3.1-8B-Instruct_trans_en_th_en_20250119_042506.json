But the thorough nature of an inquiry like this ensures it can still shock.\n\nTake a four-minute exchange at just after 11 this morning. The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses.

Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. 'We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,' he said.",

The Daily Telegraph expressed concern over rehabilitation through public channels by publishing a photo of a person released from prison accompanied by stars and the phrase 'thank you for accepting us, we will meet again'. The Daily Mail published a photo of a person arrested and separated from society in Notting Hill, describing it as an inappropriate celebration. Moreover, these newspapers also reported the story in an inappropriate manner, such as referring to individuals arrested and separated from society as 'pigs', 'dice', and calling them 'confidence'. The Sun said that the day when a person is released from prison is the day the government apologizes, but said 'this is not an error in many political changes'.",
