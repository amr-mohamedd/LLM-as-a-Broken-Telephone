While Cunegonde fights off her attacker, a captain comes in and, enraged at the officer's disrespect, kills him. He then takes Cunegonde as a prisoner of war. The captain keeps Cunegonde as his servant for three months and then sells her to a Jewish businessman. The businessman shares her services with the same Inquisitor who ordered the execution of Pangloss and flogging of Candide. Cunegonde wards off the sexual advances of both men. Cunegonde attends the post-earthquake execution and recognizes Candide. Cunegonde's story ends. Back in the present, Candide and Cunegonde eat dinner together and hang out until one of her owners, the businessman Don Issachar, comes to get her.",

He again decides to seek his son in the town, but stops when he thinks he hears a special message from the river. He remembers when he rebelled against his own father, and realizes that his father must have suffered the same pain as he, Siddhartha, suffers now. Sorrows repeat themselves. Still suffering, he returns to the hut and tells Vasudeva of his troubles. Vasudeva, in his silent attentiveness, seems to Siddhartha like a god. They both go and sit by the river bank. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and realizes the unity of all life amidst all its diverse elements. He realizes that in the unity is perfection. His pain disappears as his Self merges with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha no longer fights against his destiny. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen his friend attain enlightenment, announces that he is leaving. He is going to live in the woods and be in the unity of all things.",
