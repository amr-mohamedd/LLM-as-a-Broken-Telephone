He decides to re-explore the city in the hope of finding his son, but he stops when he thinks he hears a special message from the river. He remembers when he refused his own father and decides that his father probably felt the same pain that he feels now. The sorrows repeat themselves. He still feels pain, so he returns to the wooden hut and tells Vasudeva about his problems. Vasudeva, in his silence and attention, seems like a god to Siddhartha. They sit together by the river. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and understands the unity of life in all its elements. He understands that perfection lies in unity. His pain disappears as his Self becomes one with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha is no longer in conflict with his fate. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen that his friend has been enlightened, explains that he will leave. He will live in the forests and be the unity of everything.",

That said, they thinks it's awesome that King John had to leave the battle with a doctor's note. Just then, in comes the French Count Melun, who's trying to hold his guts so they don't fall out of his body. Melun tells the English lords to abandon their rebellion and swear allegiance to King John once more, because if the French and the rebels defeat King John, Louis the Dauphin plans to have all his English allies beheaded. At first, Salisbury can't believe him. But then Melun explains that he is about to die, anyway, and he'll get a better reward in heaven by telling the truth now than by keeping mum. Anyway, he explains, his grandfather was English, so he has some sympathy for them. Salisbury definitely doesn't want to get his head lopped off, so he decides to believe Melun.

Traddles has discovered that he can recover all of Miss Betsey's money as well as Mr. Wickfield's. Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him.

In the cellar, Defarge and Jacques listened attentively to the spy as he told them what had happened to Gaspard, the man who had murdered the duke. Gaspard had murdered the duke because he had killed his child and had quickly vanished into the shadows after committing the crime. The French authorities had recently arrested him, thrown him into prison, beheaded him, and hung his body at the city gate, where his shadow polluted the air above the village. Later, Monsieur and Madame Defarge took the spy to Versailles, where the grandeur of the court overwhelmed him. Under the influence of the emotions of the situation, the spy cheered for the king, the queen, and the other courtiers. The Defarges applauded his behavior, thinking that it would help them increase their arrogance and lack of knowledge. Moreover, the Defarges believed that he would see so much luxury and beauty that it would help him increase his hatred and violence in the future.",

She continues to blame her husband for her unhappiness, not her rabid materialism; everything is someone else's fault, and she is still a creature who is perfectly innocent of blame. She gets a letter from Will, saying that he will be paying a visit sometime soon; Rosamond is cheered up by this, and decides to send out invitations for a dinner party. Of course, all invitations are denied, and Rosamond is still ignorant as to the reason why; she goes to visit her parents, and they tell her the terrible news. When she goes home, she tells her husband that she has heard about everything; she then reiterates that they must go to London, to lessen her suffering.
