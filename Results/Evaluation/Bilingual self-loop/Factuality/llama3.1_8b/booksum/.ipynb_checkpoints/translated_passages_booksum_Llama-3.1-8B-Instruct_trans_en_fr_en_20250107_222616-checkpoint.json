That said, they thinks it's awesome that King John had to leave the battle with a doctor's note. Just then, in comes the French Count Melun, who's trying to hold his guts so they don't fall out of his body. Melun tells the English lords to abandon their rebellion and swear allegiance to King John once more, because if the French and the rebels defeat King John, Louis the Dauphin plans to have all his English allies beheaded. At first, Salisbury can't believe him. But then Melun explains that he is about to die, anyway, and he'll get a better reward in heaven by telling the truth now than by keeping mum. Anyway, he explains, his grandfather was English, so he has some sympathy for them. Salisbury definitely doesn't want to get his head lopped off, so he decides to believe Melun.

She hoped that the Osmonds had found a suitable partner in Isabel. The generous countess paid a visit to Henrietta to ask if she knew what was happening with Isabel. Countess Gemini was very impressed by the journalist and hoped to travel with her to Rome - she ardently desired to see her name in print. However, Henrietta was too busy to wait for Countess Gemini's departure and wanted to see her as soon as possible. She had planned to leave the next day. Henrietta sent a message to Caspar Goodwood in Florence, then went to the Uffizi Gallery to admire her favorite painting. Henrietta met Caspar at the Uffizi Gallery and they decided to leave for Rome the next day. Caspar was slightly hesitant, as he had mixed feelings for Henrietta, but he agreed to travel with her.",

Rosamond asks Jane to paint her portrait, and one day, while Jane is working on it, St. John appears. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. He suggests making a copy, then openly declares that he should marry Rosamond.

Rosamond, frivolous, mad, superficial, would be a terrible wife for a missionary. Suddenly, St. John notices something on the edge of Jane's paper and quickly tears off a small piece - Jane has no idea why. With a strange look on his face, he quickly leaves the room.",

As Dinah begins to preach, she draws in the villagers with her soft, loving voice, and the stranger stays to listen to her despite his reservations about a woman preacher. Dinah's sermon tells about the love Jesus has for the poor and encourages the townspeople to give up their sins and do good in the world. The villagers accept her slowly, and by the time she concludes her preaching, many of them are moved to tears",

The conversation between the Duchess and Alice is packed with statements and the moral of each of these statements. This is enough to disorient Alice, since she has never thought that everything that she said would eventually have a moral. Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle. The Mock Turtle, sitting on a little rocky ledge, is sad and constantly sighing. Alice requests the Mock Turtle to tell her, his history. The Mock Turtle very proudly lists the various subjects that were taught to him. The subjects include, Reeling and Writhing and the different branches of Arithmetic . Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day. The Mock turtle asserts that it is 'because of this that they are called lessons'.",

The diversions, however, prove to be quite different than one might expect. It is the Lilliputian court custom that men seeking political office demonstrate their agility in rope dancing, among other things. How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on. Gulliver is granted limited freedom on certain conditions. In return for abiding by the conditions, he will receive food sufficient for 1,728 Lilliputians. Gulliver swears to the articles in proper form, and the Emperor frees him.",

He continues to fight with the other dogs. When he disputes a leg bone with Baseek, White Fang tears off Baseek's right ear and inflicts a shoulder wound on him. Baseek, old and weak, realizes that he can no longer continue.\n\nIn the summer, White Fang encounters Kiche, who has now forgotten and has a new puppy. She growls around her puppy, trying to chase White Fang away from her puppy. When White Fang is three years old, a severe famine hits the region. Only the strongest will survive, as the Indians eat the weaker dogs. The Indians also eat the tender skin of their moccasins and gloves to satisfy their hunger. White Fang flees into the forest to hunt alone, sometimes stealing rabbit traps and sometimes catching smaller prey like squirrels and forest mice. At the end of the famine, White Fang encounters Lip-lip, with whom he fights until Lip-lip is killed. He then returns to the village and is warmly welcomed and receives a lot of fish.",

No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately.

Tinor inspects his clothes and food provisions; Marheyo works on his hut; the girls perfume their hair and skin with oils. The narrator usually walks around with Kory-Kory or stays indoors.

He reveals his plan to steal Edgar's inheritance and, once inside his father's chambers, pretends to be devastated by the contents of a forged letter he claims to have received from Edgar. The letter exhorts Edmund to join Edgar in a conspiracy against their father, in which they would kill the count and share his domain. The Earl of Gloucester is easily deceived by Edmund's story, likely due to the scenes he has witnessed at the king's court. Once again, Edmund mocks his father's madness. He is joined by Edgar, who advises him to protect himself against his father's wrath, suggesting that he carry a sword. The reason given by Edmund for his father's wrath is based on supernatural reasons. The obvious persuasive abilities of Edmund also have an effect on Edgar, who believes the story.",
