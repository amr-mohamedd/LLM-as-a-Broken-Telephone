When she read about the reasons behind his actions in his relationship with Bingley and Jane, she initially refused to accept the reasons for his interest in Jane, considering them insignificant and believing that he acted out of concern for her family. However, when she began reading about the reasons behind his actions in his relationship with Wickham, she started to read them more clearly. She quickly realized that she knew very little about Wickham before he spoke about him and Darcy, and wondered why she had never noticed the inconsistency in his words when speaking to strangers. Continuing to read and reflect, she realized that she was 'blind, biased, one-sided, and lacking compassion,' and believed that Darcy's reasons were right. After a two-hour walk in the park, she returned home and found that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had arrived to bid her farewell.",
