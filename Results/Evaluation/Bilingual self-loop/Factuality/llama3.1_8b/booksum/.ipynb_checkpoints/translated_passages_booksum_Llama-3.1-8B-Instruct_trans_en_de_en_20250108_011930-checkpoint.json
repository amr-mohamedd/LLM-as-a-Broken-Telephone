Initially, when she reads his explanation for his behavior towards Bingley and Jane, she rejects his justification and believes that he acted out of family motives. However, as she reads his explanation for his relationships with Wickham with greater clarity, she begins to understand him better. She soon discovers that she knew nothing about him before he told her about Wickham and himself. She wonders why she didn't notice that it was inappropriate to discuss such things with a stranger. As she continues to read and think, she concludes that she was 'blind, biased, distorting, absurd' and that she believes Darcy's version of events.

That said, they thinks it's awesome that King John had to leave the battle with a doctor's note. Just then, in comes the French Count Melun, who's trying to hold his guts so they don't fall out of his body. Melun tells the English lords to abandon their rebellion and swear allegiance to King John once more, because if the French and the rebels defeat King John, Louis the Dauphin plans to have all his English allies beheaded. At first, Salisbury can't believe him. But then Melun explains that he is about to die, anyway, and he'll get a better reward in heaven by telling the truth now than by keeping mum. Anyway, he explains, his grandfather was English, so he has some sympathy for them. Salisbury definitely doesn't want to get his head lopped off, so he decides to believe Melun.

A boy tells him it is Christmas Day, and Scrooge realizes that the ghosts visited him all in one night. Scrooge buys a prize turkey and sends it to Bob Cratchit's house. Scrooge dresses in his best clothing and walks in the crowds with a smile. He gives a great deal of money to the portly gentleman who had asked him for a charitable donation yesterday. Scrooge continues to walk through the city and happily talks with everyone he meets. He visits Fred's house and has a wonderful time at the party. The next morning, Scrooge gets to work early. When Cratchit comes in late, Scrooge pretends to reprimand him, then gives him a raise. Scrooge continues his kindly ways, befriending everyone and becoming a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die. He never sees the ghosts again, but he keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart as well as anyone.",
