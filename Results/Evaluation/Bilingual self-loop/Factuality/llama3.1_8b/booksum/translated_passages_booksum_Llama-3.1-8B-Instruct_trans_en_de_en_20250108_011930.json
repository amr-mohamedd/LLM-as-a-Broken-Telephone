Initially, when she reads his explanation for his behavior towards Bingley and Jane, she rejects his justification and believes that he acted out of family motives. However, as she reads his explanation for his relationships with Wickham with greater clarity, she begins to understand him better. She soon discovers that she knew nothing about him before he told her about Wickham and himself. She wonders why she didn't notice that it was inappropriate to discuss such things with a stranger. As she continues to read and think, she concludes that she was 'blind, biased, distorting, absurd' and that she believes Darcy's version of events.

That said, they thinks it's awesome that King John had to leave the battle with a doctor's note. Just then, in comes the French Count Melun, who's trying to hold his guts so they don't fall out of his body. Melun tells the English lords to abandon their rebellion and swear allegiance to King John once more, because if the French and the rebels defeat King John, Louis the Dauphin plans to have all his English allies beheaded. At first, Salisbury can't believe him. But then Melun explains that he is about to die, anyway, and he'll get a better reward in heaven by telling the truth now than by keeping mum.

He hurries through his house and then out, where church bells are ringing. A boy tells him that it is Christmas Day, and Scrooge realizes that the spirits visited him in a single night. Scrooge buys a magnificent turkey and sends it to the Cratchit house. Scrooge dresses in his fine evening attire and walks through the crowd with a smile. He gives generous sums to a noble gentleman who had asked for a donation the day before. Scrooge continues through the city and has pleasant conversations with everyone he meets. He visits Fred's apartment and has a wonderful dinner. The next morning, Scrooge arrives punctually on his way to work. As Cratchit is late, he accuses him, but then gives him a promotion. Scrooge remains on his gentle path, befriends everyone, and becomes like a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die. He never sees the spirits again, but he keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart, just like everyone else.",

Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen .

Gaspard, who murdered the Marquis for running down his child, went into hiding for nearly a year after the killing. The French authorities recently captured, jailed, and hanged him, and left his corpse dangling by the village fountain, with his shadow poisoning the atmosphere of the town. Monsieur and Madame Defarge later take the road-mender to Versailles, where the splendor of the court dazzles him. Caught up in the emotion of the experience, the road-mender cheers the King, Queen, and other nobles.

She also points out that Macbeth is not faithful to them, but rather to himself. Hecate, however, will bring an end to this chaos. She instructs them to meet again the next morning, on the day when Macbeth will learn his fate, whatever it may be. Then there is a captivating witches' song and dance, and all follow Hecate.\n\nSome literary critics believe that this scene is too kitschy to have been written by Shakespeare himself, so it must have been added sometime between the first draft of the play and its publication in the First Folio, which occurred after his death.

Lydgate, therefore, attends the meeting in a confused state. There is heated discussion much of personal, among the members who have earlier assembled.

Following a discussion with Farebrother and a feeling of being drawn into the problem, Lydgate found himself once again in a difficult situation. His personal preference lay with Farebrother, a man who had worked as a priest without pay because he had no other choice. It seemed unfair to reject him now on the grounds of his performance. On the other hand, Bulstrode was Lydgate's strongest supporter in the town, where he expected considerable resistance to his plans for medical reform. Thus, Lydgate found himself once again in a precarious situation. The discussion was very lively and personal among the already present members. Lydgate arrived last and found them unanimous in their opinion. Ultimately, his vote was determined by his wounded pride.

Just as she was about to turn back, the Westons drive by in their carriage and inform Emma that Frank Churchill will arrive the next day and stay for a week. They promise Emma that they will bring Frank to Hartfield. The next day, Emma visits Mr. Weston and Frank Woodhouse. Emma finds Frank very attractive and forms a good impression of his character; she is also impressed by his lively spirit. He praises Mrs. Weston for her beauty and elegant appearance.

Everyone agrees that Mr. Bingley is acceptable, but not everyone shares the same opinion about Mr. Darcy. Most women criticize his pride and arrogance, but Charlotte defends Mr. Darcy by pointing out that his 'pride' is an unavoidable consequence of his social status as a young man of rank. Elizabeth agrees with her on some points and says that she would have forgiven Mr. Darcy's pride if he had not also caused her pain.

The chapter also provides a brief overview of the Lucas family - Sir William Lucas was a merchant and was elevated to the nobility for his services as mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a good soul, but foolish. They have many children, including Charlotte as their eldest daughter, a sensible, intelligent, and practical daughter.",

He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was.

As they speak, Launcelot enters and brings Jessica's letter. Lorenzo recognizes the handwriting and explains that the hand that wrote it is 'whiter than the paper it is written on'. Lorenzo instructs Launcelot to return to Shylock's house and reassure Jessica that Lorenzo will not abandon her. Launcelot exits the scene, and Lorenzo instructs his friends to prepare for the night's festivities. Salarino and Solanio leave the conversation, and Lorenzo tells Gratiano that Jessica will escape from Shylock's house by disguising herself as one of the torchbearers of the god Dionysus. Lorenzo gives Gratiano the letter and asks him to read it first, before they prepare for the events of the night.",

What a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, but in a fiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so perfectly into my bosom, and bear a burden of my grief, so exactly as my own? Is it not monstrous that a man should be so wretched an object of compassion, and yet should be so obdurate, so unkind, so cruel to himself, as to think there is no such thing as virtue? What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue! What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue! What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue!\n\nHow all occasions do inform against me, and prompt me to a secret but violent indignation.

Is it not monstrous that a man should be so wretched an object of compassion, and yet should be so obdurate, so unkind, so cruel to himself, as to think there is no such thing as virtue? What a wretched object is man, and what a wretched object is he who thinks there is no such thing as virtue!\n\nTo be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them. To die, to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pitch and moment, with this regard, their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action. \n\nBut soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and the sun is rising.

            "text": "The scene begins on a field in Denmark. Prince Fortinbras from Norway marches with his army through Denmark on his way to Poland. Hamlet appears with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and meets a captain who describes the small and worthless stretch in Poland that the young Fortinbras wants to acquire. Hamlet broods over the futility of war, the bloodshed, and the stubborn Poles who will fight to the bitter end for their worthless land. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern leave him, so that Hamlet can have the opportunity to think alone. He compares his inactivity with the aggressive behavior of the young Fortinbras and cries out in despair: 'How all occasions do inform against me, and spur my dull revenge! What is a man? If his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed, a bear, a beast, no more. Is this a noble and most sovereign reason, what is this reason? Why, it is good to be undone, to be not trusted. It is good to be not loved, but to be feared. No, no, no, it is good to be feared, but not to be hated. To be loved is good, to be feared is to be respected, but to be hated is to be despised. Ah, why do I say this? Why do I say this? I am a wretched, miserable, and pitiful worm.

Hamlet appears with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and meets a captain who describes the small and worthless stretch of land in Poland that the young Fortinbras wants to acquire. Hamlet broods over the futility of war, the bloodshed, and the stubborn rabble that will fight to the bitter end for their worthless land. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern leave him to think alone. He compares his inactivity with the aggressive behavior of the young Fortinbras and cries out in desperation: 'How all occasions do instruct me in the fine art of self-destruction! How all occasions do instruct me in the fine art of self-destruction! For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pitch and moment, with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action.

They discuss the likely consequences of Romes premature discovery of their preparations for war. Aufidius is irritated by this development and reproaches the First Senator for not keeping the Volscian preparations a closely guarded secret.

In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power.

Exclusive sovereignty refers to the power that can only be exercised by the states or the federal government. In the context of administration, the tax autonomy of the federal government vis-à-vis citizens implies that the states can do nothing, as administration is a joint influence.
