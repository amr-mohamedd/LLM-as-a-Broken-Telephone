That said, they thinks it's awesome that King John had to leave the battle with a doctor's note. Just then, in comes the French Count Melun, who's trying to hold his guts so they don't fall out of his body. Melun tells the English lords to abandon their rebellion and swear allegiance to King John once more, because if the French and the rebels defeat King John, Louis the Dauphin plans to have all his English allies beheaded. At first, Salisbury can't believe him. But then Melun explains that he is about to die, anyway, and he'll get a better reward in heaven by telling the truth now than by keeping mum. Anyway, he explains, his grandfather was English, so he has some sympathy for them. Salisbury definitely doesn't want to get his head lopped off, so he decides to believe Melun.

Miss Minchin isn't very nice to Ermengarde, and because of this, Sara feels the need to reach out to her. After lessons, Sara introduces herself. Ermengarde goes on about how clever Sara must be because she can speak French. Sara does what any child would upon making a friend --she asks Ermengarde if she'd like to meet Emily, her doll. When she starts to tell fantastical stories about Emily, Ermengarde is amazed at how she's able to just make things up on the fly. Suddenly, Sara looks like she's in pain. Ermengarde asks her what is up with that, and Sara responds that she's in pain because she misses her father. Then, Ermengarde asks Sara if she'd like to be her best friend.

Meanwhile, St. John kept his distance and continued to show an unfriendly attitude. A month later, Diana and Mary had to return to their teaching positions. St. John found a job for Jane, managing a private boarding school for girls in the town of Morton. Jane agreed, but St. John thought she would soon leave the school because Jane felt disappointed, possibly because he was also unstable. St. John's sisters suspected that he would soon leave England to take up a diplomatic position. St. John said that his brother, John, had passed away, leaving nothing behind after he had given all his property to distant relatives he did not know.",

Hector says he really likes the guy's armor and wouldn't mind having it in his trophy case. Then he runs after the shiny trophy.",

According to the plan previously set, Hamlet arrives on time, at midnight, accompanied by Horatio and Marcellus, who have been waiting for the King's appearance.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the sound of gunfire and loud explosions echoes in the air.  In a state of anxiety, Hamlet explains that it is a sign that his brother, the new King, and his brother-in-law have participated in the traditional festivities.  However, the King is possessed by an evil spirit.\n\nHamlet calls out to the King, saying 'Oh, do you want me to wait?  Come here, my handsome Swiss guards' and asks the King what he should do.  Possessed by an evil spirit, the King leads Hamlet to a different location.  Horatio and Marcellus advise Hamlet not to follow the King, out of concern for his safety and even his life;  but Hamlet is not serious about their advice, asking them how to bid farewell to the King when they try to follow him.  Horatio and Marcellus think 'There is something wrong in Denmark' and decide to follow Hamlet.",

He's there to thank them for everything they've done for his family. He seems to be very content, though it's only a break from his constant sadness. At 9pm, he leaves to go home. As he departs, he makes the sign of the cross over Grandmother and tells her that she's a good woman. He adds that the prayers of all good people are good.",

Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her?

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death . A fellow playwright, Thomas Middleton, may have written the snazzy songs in this scene.",

She was unhappy that they had interfered with Macbeth's work without her consent, as if she could do better. She also pointed out that Macbeth was not loyal to them, but only to himself. However, in reality, Hecate was not concerned about this issue. She told them that they would meet again the next morning, when Macbeth would know his fate, meaning that Macbeth would meet his death. Then, there was a song and a dance of the witches, and everyone followed Hecate.",

Mrs. Johnson offered to buy Jimmie a beer. Luckily, Jimmie's father intervened just in time and took the beer away from Mrs. Johnson. Mrs. Johnson could no longer continue living the 'hard' life in this apartment. Jimmie went out to play before returning home. He could hear his parents arguing, threatening, and fighting with the furniture; the neighbors commented that 'Mrs. Johnson' was acting that way. In reality, Jimmie had become a local celebrity with his parents' way of living. Finally, Jimmie bravely returned home, and when he did, he saw his parents were too intoxicated and lying on the floor. He and Maggie hugged each other, shaking and scared, until 'the light' started.",

The conversation between the Duchess and Alice is packed with statements and the moral of each of these statements. This is enough to disorient Alice, since she has never thought that everything that she said would eventually have a moral. Frightened by the Queen, the Duchess finally leaves and Alice is now encouraged by the Queen to meet the Mock Turtle. The Queen orders the Gryphon  to take Alice to the Mock turtle. The Mock Turtle, sitting on a little rocky ledge, is sad and constantly sighing. Alice requests the Mock Turtle to tell her, his history. The Mock Turtle very proudly lists the various subjects that were taught to him. The subjects include, Reeling and Writhing and the different branches of Arithmetic . Apart from this were Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Stretching and Fainting. What excites Alice about the Mock Turtles school is that the duration of attendance would lessen day by day. The Mock turtle asserts that it is 'because of this that they are called lessons'.",

The diversions, however, prove to be quite different than one might expect. It is the Lilliputian court custom that men seeking political office demonstrate their agility in rope dancing, among other things. How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on.

She arrives believing that there is some property belonging to her late father in Paris, but Mr. Lorry breaks the news to her that her father is still alive. He is Dr. Manette who has been imprisoned in the Bastille in Paris for the last eighteen years. The French authorities have recently released him and as he was one of Tellson's Bank's clients, Mr. Lorry has been sent to identify him. It is hoped that Lucie will take the responsibility for caring for her father and bringing him back to health. Lucie is taken aback at this news and she faints. A large red-haired woman runs into the room pushing Mr. Lorry aside and going to the young lady's assistance using smelling salts and cold water to revive her.",

A crowd of somber, dreary-looking people has gathered outside the door of a prison in seventeenth-century Boston. The building's heavy oak door is studded with iron spikes, and the prison appears to have been constructed to hold dangerous criminals. No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately. This is true of the citizens of Boston, who built their prison some twenty years earlier. The one incongruity in the otherwise drab scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door. The narrator suggests that it offers a reminder of Nature's kindness to the condemned; for his tale, he says, it will provide either a 'sweet moral blossom' or else some relief in the face of unrelenting sorrow and gloom",

His stepmother frequently comes to clean up the rooms he rents out, and he has a strange approach to discipline in his experiences. He wants to do those things, but he chooses specific experiences and then leaves them and intentionally lives through them. For example, when he fell in love with Helen White, he limited what he allowed himself to think about her. One night, he decided he should try drinking to see what it's like. He bought a bottle of whiskey and walked about a mile north of town, where he sat on a patch of green grass and got drunk. When drunk, he stood up and talked to George Willard about Helen. George was initially shocked, but eventually, they formed a close relationship. Tom decided that now that he's drunk, he doesn't need to try it again.",

Charlotte Lucas has overheard Bingley remark that Jane is pretty and that he likes her very much. Everyone unanimously approves of Bingley, but they are in disagreement about Darcy. Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'. Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's pride if he had not affronted hers. Mary philosophically muses about the distinction between 'pride' and 'vanity'. The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas was a tradesman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, the eldest of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical girl.",

Most women criticized Darcy for his haughty and distant demeanor, but Charlotte defended him by saying that his 'haughtiness' was an unavoidable consequence of his social position as a 'young handsome man with property'. Elizabeth agreed with her in part and said that she could easily forgive Darcy's 'haughtiness' if he didn't offend her. Mary pondered the difference between 'haughtiness' and 'good humor'. This chapter also provides a summary of the Lucas family - Sir William Lucas had been a merchant and was knighted when he was mayor. He is a friendly and polite person. His wife has a good heart, but is too silly. They have many children, and their eldest child is Charlotte, a clever, intelligent, and practical girl.",

Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts. Maisie realizes that this means she won't get to see Mrs. Wix or say goodbye--but only after it's too late.",

He returns to the shore to get his piece of wood, planning to try and float across, but the yard has floated back out to sea. David is now miserable. He begins eating raw shellfish. Sometimes he manages to keep them down, and other times they make him extremely sick. He is especially depressed because he can see a church and several houses on the mainland, but he knows he cannot cross the river.

He sees some fisherman, and wildly hails them from the shore. But, to his shock, they only point and laugh at him.

Banquo tells Macbeth of King Duncan's pleasure at having been so royally treated. He asks Macbeth if he has been thinking of the weird sisters; Macbeth falsely responds in the negative.

She must reschedule the picnic because it is rainy and set up everything again the next day. When she goes out to buy lobster, she runs into a friend of Laurie's. He sees the lobster, which was considered low-class food at the time, and she is very embarrassed, although she manages to recover and charm him. Finally, the party begins, but only one person shows up. During the party, Amy is delightful and merry, but she is very disappointed at the way things have turned out. Her family is very kind and tactful",

It discusses the notion of concurrent powers and exclusive powers as they relate to taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both the states and federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",

In the case of taxation, the federal government's power to impose taxes does not exclude states from doing the same because taxation is a concurrent power.
