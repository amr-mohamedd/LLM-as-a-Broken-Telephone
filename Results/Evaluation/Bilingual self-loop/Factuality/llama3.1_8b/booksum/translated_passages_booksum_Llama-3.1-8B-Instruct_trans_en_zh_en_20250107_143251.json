The captain keeps Cunegonde as his servant for three months and then sells her to a Jewish businessman. The businessman shares her services with the same Inquisitor who ordered the execution of Pangloss and flogging of Candide. Cunegonde wards off the sexual advances of both men. Cunegonde attends the post-earthquake execution and recognizes Candide. Cunegonde's story ends. Back in the present, Candide and Cunegonde eat dinner together and hang out until one of her owners, the businessman Don Issachar, comes to get her.",

He again decides to seek his son in the town, but stops when he thinks he hears a special message from the river. He remembers when he rebelled against his own father, and realizes that his father must have suffered the same pain as he, Siddhartha, suffers now. Sorrows repeat themselves. Still suffering, he returns to the hut and tells Vasudeva of his troubles. Vasudeva, in his silent attentiveness, seems to Siddhartha like a god. They both go and sit by the river bank. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and realizes the unity of all life amidst all its diverse elements. He realizes that in the unity is perfection. His pain disappears as his Self merges with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha no longer fights against his destiny. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen his friend attain enlightenment, announces that he is leaving. He is going to live in the woods and be in the unity of all things.",

Simple as that. Next, the Prologue warns us that we might not like the play because nothing good ever really happens in times of 'war.'

Mrs. Weston disagrees, believing that Emma needs Harriet's companionship and that Emma's company will improve Harriet. She advises Knightley to keep his mouth shut, and the conversation ends with speculation about what will become of Emma. Noting Emma's declaration that she will never marry and her lack of suitable prospects, Knightley comments that he 'should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good",

            "text": "Hamilton defends the treaty-making procedures outlined in the Constitution. He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time.

It is a time when many people think they live in the best of times, while others condemn it as the worst of times. The kings of England and France are both mediocre rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People are put to death for the slightest of crimes. The condition in France is very bad, for there is a total disregard for the common people by the aristocracy; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are rampant. The aristocracy is unaware that the masses are preparing for the revolution by turning timber into guillotines and farm carts into tumbrels to convey people to the guillotine. In England, too, lawlessness and poverty prevail. Even the colonies in America are up in arms against their English rulers, and the attempts of the American colonies to obtain freedom are not taken seriously.",

Jane continues to pay attention to the relationship between St. John and Rosamond, who often visits the school when she knows St. John will be there. Rosamond asks Jane to draw her portrait, and as she is working on it one day, St. John pays her a visit. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. She offers to draw him a duplicate, and then boldly declares that he ought to marry Rosamond. St. John admits that he loves her and is tempted by her beauty, but he explains that he refuses to allow worldly affection to interfere with his holy duties. The flirtatious, silly, and shallow Rosamond would make a terrible wife for a missionary. Suddenly, St. John notices something on the edge of Jane's paper and tears off a tiny piece--Jane is not certain why. With a peculiar look on his face, he hurries from the room",

Well, of course not - isn't her originality the very thing that people love about her? Not only does he hate her opinions and beliefs, he also takes offense to the whole manner with which she conducts her life.

Isabel and Osmond have barely been speaking to one another. Isabel knows that Osmond is upset and jealous about Ralph's stay in Rome. Isabel has not told Ralph how miserable her life is. She thinks that it is better for him to think that he was wrong all along, although, in fact, he was all too right. Isabel stays up until four in the morning thinking things over.

Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess.

Lydgate, therefore, attends the meeting in a confused state. There is heated discussion much of personal, among the members who have earlier assembled.

Mr. Wrench, an old style medical practitioner, declares that it is well known that Lydgate will vote will Bulstrode. Incensed, Lydgate does just that. So Mr. Tyke becomes the hospital chaplain.

How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on. Gulliver is granted limited freedom on certain conditions. In return for abiding by the conditions, he will receive food sufficient for 1,728 Lilliputians.

            "text": "On a Friday afternoon in November 1875, a carriage heading to Dover became increasingly hazardous due to thick fog. Three passengers alighted to take shelter from the rain. As the carriage descended, a samurai suddenly emerged from the fog, demanding to see a passenger named Grayhock. The passengers suspected him of being a thief or an imposter, but lacked evidence to substantiate the charge.\n\nMr. Topper recognized the samurai's accent as belonging to one of his employees, and inferred Grayhock's whereabouts. Mr. Topper immediately scribbled a letter to Grayhock on a piece of paper, writing: 'Dover, awaiting Mr. Morland.' He requested that Grayhock return to Topper's Bank to collect the letter. Although still uneasy about these enigmatic details, Mr. Topper handed Grayhock over to the samurai, allowing him to continue his journey.",

Were it more welcoming, the bank's partners believe, it would lose its status as a respectable business. It is located by Temple Bar, the spot where, until recently, the government displayed the heads of executed criminals. The narrator explains that at this time, 'death was a recipe much in vogue,' used against all manner of criminals, from forgers to horse thieves to counterfeiters. Jerry Cruncher, employed by Tellson's as a runner and messenger, wakes up in his small apartment, located in an unsavory London neighborhood. He begins the day by yelling at his wife for 'praying against' him; he throws his muddy boot at her. Around nine o'clock, Cruncher and his young son camp outside Tellson's Bank, where they await the bankers' instructions. When an indoor messenger calls for a porter, Cruncher takes off to do the job. As young Jerry sits alone, he wonders why his father's fingers always have rust on them",

A crowd of somber, dreary-looking people has gathered outside the door of a prison in seventeenth-century Boston. The building's heavy oak door is studded with iron spikes, and the prison appears to have been constructed to hold dangerous criminals. No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately. This is true of the citizens of Boston, who built their prison some twenty years earlier. The one incongruity in the otherwise drab scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door. The narrator suggests that it offers a reminder of Nature's kindness to the condemned; for his tale, he says, it will provide either a 'sweet moral blossom' or else some relief in the face of unrelenting sorrow and gloom",

The founders immediately established a cemetery next to the prison. The Boston residents had built this prison twenty years ago. The most striking element of this scene is the rose at the prison entrance. The author believes that this rose reminds us that even in the natural world, there is compassion for prisoners.\n\nIn this novel, the author describes the rose as 'a sweet moral flower' or 'a consolation in the face of endless pain and darkness.'",

Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'.

Maisie has a hard time accepting that Sir Claude would have lied to her. But soon enough, she gets proof that he has been seeing Mrs. Beale when he takes her to her father's house to see her. Before they arrive at Mrs. Beale's, Sir Claude says that he doesn't think Mrs. Wix's plan for all of them to live together will work out. But, he says Maisie can stay with Mrs. Beale, and he will come to visit her often. Maisie accepts. Maisie realizes that this means she won't get to see Mrs. Wix or say goodbye--but only after it's too late.",

This mystery man seems to him just like 'my king's ideal knight,' especially because he followed his conscience above all else and was completely dedicated to one woman. He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was. Even though his position on the throne made him especially vulnerable to criticism, he appears blameless. Who could wish for a better life for his only son, or hope for more for his son's sons than that they resemble such an excellent father--Albert the Good? Now the author addresses the widowed queen, telling her to be strong and endure in the memory of the light they two shared.

He tried to cross the river, but found it too wide and the current too strong, so he returned to the riverbank, took out his board, and decided to try again. However, his board was swept away by the waves, leaving a desperate feeling.\n\nHe started eating live shellfish, occasionally managing to swallow a few mouthfuls, but often feeling very uncomfortable, especially when he longed to escape, and he could see churches and houses on the mainland, but he knew he couldn't cross the river.\n\nThe next day, he was surprised to see a red deer swimming in the river. He also discovered that he had lost all his money because his boat had sunk. He saw fishermen on the riverbank shouting loudly, but he was surprised that they were laughing at him.\n\nThe fishermen later returned and exchanged a few words with him: 'The tide has receded, the water is shallow.' David felt both astonished and embarrassed, realizing that when the tide receded, he could almost jump across the river.\n\nDavid felt both astonished and embarrassed, realizing that when the tide receded, he could almost jump across the river.",

Ovid is extremely angry, accusing the first senator of leaking Rome's military strategy. The first senator denies leaking any military information, but Ovid produces a letter he received four days earlier, revealing that Gaius Cosinius, Marcus, and Titus Labienus launched a surprise attack, sparking panic among Roman citizens.\n\nThe second senator tries to calm Ovid's anger, suggesting he lead the soldiers. In the final scene, Ovid says that if he were to encounter Marcus on the battlefield, he would certainly engage in a fierce duel with him.",

Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations.
