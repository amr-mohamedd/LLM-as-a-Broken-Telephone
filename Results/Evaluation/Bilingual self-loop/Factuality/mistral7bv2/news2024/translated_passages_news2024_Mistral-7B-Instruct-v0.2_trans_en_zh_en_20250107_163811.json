However, for more serious crimes, '青年狱' (gaizao yu) or '改造校' (gaizao xiao) are used, which translate to 'juvenile prison' or 'reform school' in English, respectively. Regardless of the terms used in both languages, these institutions serve to detain, educate, and reform juvenile criminal offenders.\n\nNote: In English, 'reform school' and 'reform camp' have slightly different meanings, but both are used to refer to institutions for the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. In this context, '改造校' (gaizao xiao) in Chinese is a more general term that covers both 'reform school' and 'reform camp.'",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",
