We're closing our coverage now, but before we go here's a recap from today's show.\n\nWe heard from Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who acknowledged that families have been let down over decades by the infected blood scandal, though he wouldn't be drawn on the amount of compensation due.\n\nOn Ukraine he said the west 'took its eye off the ball' and he doesn't want a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nShadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting outlined plans to cut NHS waiting lists and said a future Labour government would ensure victims of the infected blood scandal are compensated.\n\nWe also had an interview with Leonid Volkov, former aide to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is 'bluffing'.\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.
