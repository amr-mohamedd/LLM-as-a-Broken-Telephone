Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said they were called just after 09:00 BST after 'a piece of expected unexploded ordnance was discovered' at Whiteley Meadows, Curbridge. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team made the area safe and the item was found to be a 'training device'. Train services stopped briefly between Eastleigh and Fareham but have now resumed, Network Rail confirmed.\n\nOfficers from British Transport Police, and Network Rail, assisted as the item was close to the railway. A Network Rail spokesperson said: 'We were contacted by the emergency services regarding a suspected unexploded bomb in close proximity to the railway near Botley. 'In order to protect passengers, we blocked the line in that area. 'Following further investigations by explosives experts, it transpired that the item was a training device. Normal working has been resumed. 'We thank passengers for their patience during these investigations.'",

Few ever hear about them.\n\nNot for Jay, 19, whose family have been thrust into a national spotlight during a month-long search that has captivated millions of people on social media.\n\nYet the facts in Jay's case now seem relatively simple. He got lost in treacherous terrain and fell to his death.\n\nHis family hoped the viral frenzy would end when his body was found last week. But it did not.\n\nMany are now asking one question: why did it take 29 days to find him?\n\nWe’ve spent time in Tenerife over the past month inside the search for Jay, reporting on the riddle.\n\nWhat we've seen raises both questions and answers.",

The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent. Only later did it admit that for the first time ever China had fired ballistic missiles over the top of the island, into the Pacific Ocean.",

Hyperia at Thorpe Park opened to the public on 24 May but stopped running the day after. In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

The 36-year-old American won by unanimous decision at the BMO Stadium to extend his unbeaten record to 41 fights. A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez. 'If the money is right, we've got to fight,' said Crawford.\n• None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

He was also disqualified from driving for three years.\n\nThe force said Ronchi 'demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of other road users when he sped through a built-up residential area in such a reckless manner'.",

The small ceramic animal, which had been treasured for 55 years by Canadian Raymond Patten, was auctioned in Staffordshire on Tuesday. It was given to him on his 21st birthday by a great aunt who worked as a cook at Cambridge University. 'I believe she knew the future King on a personal basis. I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.' Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance. 'He is in his retirement years and wanted to find it a new home where it would be treasured for decades to come.'

He added: 'They were proud of the fact that he had studied at the University of Cambridge in the late 1960s while working as a kitchen helper at Queens' College, the President's College.'\n\nThe ceramic figurines, which fetched 8,500 £ at auction, once belonged to Raymond Patten in Canada. He had received them as a gift from his aunt on his 21st birthday. 'I believe she had been personally acquainted with the Prince of Wales. I have carried this collector's item with me my whole life,' said Mr. Patten.\n\nCharles Hanson of Hansons Auctions commented: 'Raymond donated the figurines due to their historical significance. He was retired and seeking a place where they would be honored for decades.'\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram: bbcstokeandstaffordshire.
