            "text": "Ariel Geller's family was invited for a guided tour of Haifa's Hecht Museum in Israel, a few days after the four-year-old smashed a rare, 3,500-year-old jar in the museum.\n\nThe museum told the BBC the crockery dated back to the Bronze Age between 2200 and 1500BC - and was a rare artefact because it was so intact.\n\nThe jar was one of the artefacts kept out in the open, part of the museum's vision of allowing visitors explore the past without any glass or barriers.\n\nThe jar was most likely originally intended to be used to carry local supplies, such as wine and olive oil. It predates the time of the Biblical King David and King Solomon and is characteristic of the Canaan region on the eastern Mediterranean coast.",

The following day at the presidential office, she was presented with one of Taiwan’s highest state honors.\n\nTo a place so starved of international recognition there was much to celebrate. Not since 1996 had such a high-profile serving US politician touched Taiwan soil.\n\nBut there would be a price. China kicked off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following her visit.\n\nDays after her plane departed Song Shan air-base, Japan reported it was tracking multiple Chinese missiles heading towards the island.\n\nTaiwan's defence ministry was strangely silent.

Tourists were kept in Hyperia at Thorpe Park in Surrey on a Saturday morning. The attraction remained closed for the rest of the day. According to the park app, it opened again on Sunday at 10:00 BST and the estimated waiting time was approximately 90 minutes. Hyperia was launched on May 25, but was closed from May 26 to June 12 while workers carried out various safety inspections.\n\nHyperia is 72m (236ft) tall and reaches a top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). In a Saturday statement, Thorpe Park assured its guests of no safety risks during the short waiting time in Hyperia. Thorpe Park said: 'Guests had waited approximately an hour on the loading platform before the ride restarted and the train returned to the attraction platform. 'Pauses are normal and experienced in amusement parks everywhere.'\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "text": "Rene, 31, suffered severe injuries and could not be saved\n\nA chimpanzee has died at Edinburgh Zoo after it was severely injured in a troop fight. Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez.

The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",
