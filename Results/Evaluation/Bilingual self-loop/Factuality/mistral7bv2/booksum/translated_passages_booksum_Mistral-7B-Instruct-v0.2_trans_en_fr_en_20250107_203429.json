Un acteur en armure monte sur scène et nous accueille à Troy, où les Grecs et les Trojiens se battent depuis...environ 7 ans sur les champs de bataille trojiens. Le Prologue nous met rapidement au courant. En un mot, pour ceux d'entre nous qui ne savent rien, voici ce qui se passe : Les Grecs ont traversé la 'baie d'Athéna' pour piller Troy parce qu'un prince trojan nommé Paris a volé Hélène, reine des Grecs, à Menelaus, roi des Grecs, et vit avec elle depuis. Rien de plus complexe à cela. Le Prologue nous avertit ensuite que nous pourrions ne pas apprécier la pièce car rien de bien ne se produit durant 'les guerres'. De plus, le Prologue ne dit rien du tout des personnages Troilus et Cressida, auxquels Shakespeare a donné le nom à la pièce. Donc, qu'est-ce que c'est pour cela ?\n\nTranslation in Modern Standard French:\nNous commençons par un prologue. Un acteur en armure monte sur scène et nous accueille",

He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making. However, Hamilton responds that this would introduce unnecessary delays and inefficiencies to the process and weaken the American negotiating position.",

The colonies in America rebel against their English governors, and the efforts of the American colonies to obtain their freedom are not taken seriously.\n\nTranslation:\n\nIn the opening chapter, the historical context in which the novel unfolds is outlined. The story takes place around fifteen years before the French Revolution. It is an era in which some believe they live in the best of times, while others view it as the worst. Both the kings of England and France are poor rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People are put to death for petty offenses. The situation in France is especially dire, as there is no respect for the commons of the nobles; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are rampant. The nobility is unaware that the masses are planning a revolution, turning wood into guillotines and agricultural carts into tumbrels to transport people to the guillotine. In England too, unrest and poverty prevail. The American colonies rebel against their English governors, and their attempts to gain their freedom are dismissed.",

Rosamond asks Jane to draw her portrait, and as she is working on it one day, St. John pays her a visit. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. She offers to draw him a duplicate, and then boldly declares that he ought to marry Rosamond. St. John admits that he loves her and is tempted by her beauty, but he explains that he refuses to allow worldly affection to interfere with his holy duties.

Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip.",

Tom used to be the stable boy at the Whites' house, but because he is rather dreamy and irresponsible, he lost that position. Now, he does odd jobs and is quite happy. His grandmother comes regularly to clean his rented rooms, and he has a rather oddly disciplined approach to life experiences. He wants to do things, but he chooses specific experiences and then goes out and intentionally lives them. For example, having fallen in love with Helen White, he limits what he allows himself to think about her. One night, he decides he ought to try drinking to see what it feels like. He buys a bottle of whiskey and walks about a mile north of town, where he sits on a bank of grass and gets drunk. In his drunkenness, he goes and talks to George Willard about Helen. George is upset at first, but then they cement a bond between them. Tom decides that, now that he has been drunk, he will not need to try it again.",

Charlotte Lucas has overheard Bingley remark that Jane is pretty and that he likes her very much. Everyone unanimously approves of Bingley, but they are in disagreement about Darcy. Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'. Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's pride if he had not affronted hers. Mary philosophically muses about the distinction between 'pride' and 'vanity'. The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas was a tradesman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, the eldest of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical girl.",

At the beginning of the trial, Bartle noticed nothing particular. He observed that Hetty's lawyer was skillful, despite the damages. Well-dressed women in the court whispered among themselves as they looked at Hetty. Hetty remained silent when invited to plead guilty or not guilty, allowing her to plead not guilty. Mr. Poyser was almost mute when called to testify, and Mr. Irwine helped him leave the courtroom. Adam asked if anyone was with Hetty, and Bartle replied negatively. Adam intends to accompany the schoolteacher to the trial. (English Translation)",

(Note: In this translation, I have remained faithful to the tone and context of the passage while translating it from French to English. The term 'trou de cochon' has been translated as 'pig's hole' in English, which has a similar vulgar and humorous meaning.)",

Les pouvoirs exclusifs sont ceux qui peuvent être exercés uniquement par une seule partie, soit un État soit le gouvernement fédéral. En matière de taxes, la capacité du gouvernement fédéral à percevoir des taxes ne remplace pas celle des États, car l'imposition de taxes est un pouvoir partagé. Cependant, le pouvoir d'administration d'un État pour imposer des droits de douane sur les importations et les exportations est lié à cela. Le Congrès peut imposer des droits de douane, mais les États peuvent le faire seulement avec l'approbation du Congrès.
