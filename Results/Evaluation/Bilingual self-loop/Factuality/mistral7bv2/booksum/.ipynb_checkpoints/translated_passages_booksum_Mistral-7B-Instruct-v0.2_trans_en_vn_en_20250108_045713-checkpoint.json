That said, they thinks it's awesome that King John had to leave the battle with a doctor's note. Just then, in comes the French Count Melun, who's trying to hold his guts so they don't fall out of his body. Melun tells the English lords to abandon their rebellion and swear allegiance to King John once more, because if the French and the rebels defeat King John, Louis the Dauphin plans to have all his English allies beheaded. At first, Salisbury can't believe him. But then Melun explains that he is about to die, anyway, and he'll get a better reward in heaven by telling the truth now than by keeping mum. Anyway, he explains, his grandfather was English, so he has some sympathy for them. Salisbury definitely doesn't want to get his head lopped off, so he decides to believe Melun. Salisbury and the other English nobles leave the stage, taking Melun with them.",

Mrs. Micawber is very concerned that Mr. Micawber should repair her relationship with her family before they leave. Agnes, Traddles, David, and Miss Betsey meet to discuss the Micawbers' finances. Traddles has discovered that he can recover all of Miss Betsey's money as well as Mr. Wickfield's. Agnes says she will rent out the house and run a school in order to keep herself and her father financially secure. David, meanwhile, decides he will go abroad. Traddles reports that Uriah has left town with his mother, and no one knows what has become of him. Arrangements are made to provide for the Micawbers' debts and raise enough money to get them to Australia. Two days later, Miss Betsey takes David to a hospital and to a funeral. She tells him that her husband has died, and that he will not be a threat to her anymore",

He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making. However, Hamilton responds that this would introduce unnecessary delays and inefficiencies to the process and weaken the American negotiating position.",

Others refer to the right to form contracts as limited for the government. Hamilton responds that, unlike Dalasio the Good, the US government can only operate within a specified time frame. He can accept a contract that does not benefit the foreign country but benefits himself, as he will later return to being a regular government. Thus, his power needs to be protected by Congress.
