When Cratchit comes in late, Scrooge pretends to reprimand him, then gives him a raise.

Here are the deets: the Greeks have sailed across the 'Athenian Bay' to 'ransack' Troy because a Trojan Prince named Paris stole Helen from the Greek King Menelaus and has been sleeping with her ever since.

He responds to the criticism that the Constitution wrongly mixes the legislative and executive branches of government by affording both a role in making and approving treaties. Hamilton argues that act of treaty-making does not fit neatly into the typical purview of either the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, affording a role to both is appropriate. Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen . It is therefore necessary that his power be held in check by the legislature. Others asserted that the Congress should have even greater authority over treaty making. However, Hamilton responds that this would introduce unnecessary delays and inefficiencies to the process and weaken the American negotiating position.",

In particular, Mr. Rann complains about the wheelwright, Will Maskery, who is a Methodist and has made disparaging remarks about Mr. Irwine and Rann.

Rosamond asks Jane to draw her portrait, and as she is working on it one day, St. John pays her a visit. He gives her a new book of poetry and looks at the drawing. She offers to draw him a duplicate, and then boldly declares that he ought to marry Rosamond.

Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip.",

As earlier planned, Hamlet arrives with Horatio and Marcellus, just before midnight in order to watch for the Ghost. While they are speaking to one another, a flourish of trumpets and canon fire is heard in the distance. Hamlet explains in disgust that this is a sign that the new King, his uncle and stepfather, is engaged in his customary drunken revelry. Suddenly the ghost appears. Hamlet addresses the apparition as 'King, father; royal Dane' and implores it to reveal the reason for its nocturnal wanderings. The ghost simply beckons Hamlet to follow it to another place. Horatio and Marcellus beg Hamlet not to obey the ghost, fearing it would be dangerous and could even lead to his death; but Hamlet ignores his friends' warnings, breaks away from them when they try to physically restrain him, and follows the Ghost. Horatio and Marcellus are convinced that 'something is rotten in the state of Denmark' and decide to follow Hamlet.",

Tinor inspects her cloth and food supplies; Marheyo works on his hut; the girls adorn their hair and skin with oils. The narrator usually wanders with Kory-Kory or else sits inside. Then they enjoy a midday nap. Usually in the afternoon, the narrator goes to the Ti, where Mehevi and the other chiefs gather. Since women are not allowed in the Ti, it resembles a happy bachelor pad where the best food can be found and where the men sit around smoking and talking. After night falls, a light evening meal of 'poee-poee,' cooked breadfruit, is eaten. Native girls often dance around their huts under the moonlight. Everyone then sleeps.

Richard replies that he needs to wait until he is sure that the various forces he is depending on are marshaled and ready. Robin Hood also fears that Richard should not stay in the forest too long.

Then Robin confesses the ruse to Richard, and Richard realizes that it is indeed time for him to move on.

He was faithful to a woman for whom his loss is particularly devastating. Ooh, a clue. Now that he's gone, everyone realizes how great he was. Even though his position on the throne made him especially vulnerable to criticism, he appears blameless. Who could wish for a better life for his only son, or hope for more for his son's sons than that they resemble such an excellent father--Albert the Good? Now the author addresses the widowed queen, telling her to be strong and endure in the memory of the light they two shared.

Suddenly, soldiers appeared, startled to find him clutching it. They hinted that nature might change, gesturing at his nose. Even secretly inhaling its scent. Suddenly, nature wept: 'Pig manure!' Pushing aside a soldier. (Note: The last sentence in the original text is unclear and I assumed it was 'nature' that said 'pig manure' and pushed away a soldier, but the context is unclear and this may not be the intended meaning.)",

When the First Senator denies any knowledge of a military leak, Aufidius produces a letter that he had received four days earlier stating that the Romans have raised an army against the Volscians under the leadership of Cominius, Marcius, and Titus Lartius.

It discusses the notion of concurrent powers and exclusive powers as they relate to taxation. Concurrent powers are those that both the states and federal government share. Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.' However, Hamilton asserts that the prudence of governments can be relied on to avoid such situations. It is not necessarily a 'direct contradiction of power' for a state government and Congress to impose the same tax.",

The bundles were then transformed into a strong, flexible rope, which was used to make a loom, a wooden frame with adjustable pressure rods.

Tomi had lived in the valley for about two months, and his legs had healed. One day, Tomi made a bamboo arrow and bow for a six-year-old boy. This bamboo arrow would shoot objects when agitated by the wind. The boy was very interested. Soon, many people gathered there, asking Tomi to make more. He agreed, and they happily played for nearly ten days. Tomi wore shoes brought from the boat by the bedside. One day, Marupru expressed interest in their craft, and Tomi made shoes for him. Marupru wore them around his chest like a strange necklace. Commonly, women were responsible for weaving, also known as 'sewing.' Weaving involved cutting down tree branches, soaking them in water for several days to soften the bark, baking the bark to make it easy to strip and clean the fibers, then dividing them into bundles based on length and thickness differences, and finally turning them into a strong, flexible rope, used to build ladders, frames, and adjustable pressure poles. The vertical lines of the ladder were fixed by the pressure poles and the front and rear poles, while the horizontal lines were secured with a single string line, passing horizontally through the ladder and crossing the vertical lines.",

Together they plant a garden, but dig up Joseph's plants to do it. When Heathcliff scolds them for touching the property, Cathy stands up for herself, saying, 'You shouldn't grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament when you have taken all my land!' . She also accuses Heathcliff of robbing Hareton of his land and money. Heathcliff storms out. He returns later to find Hareton and Cathy reading together. Unexpectedly, Heathcliff does not fly into a rage. Instead he confesses to Nelly that he has lost interest in revenge. 'hen everything is ready, and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished!' . Heathcliff continues to be struck by Hareton's resemblance to Catherine. But then, everything reminds him of Catherine. He tells Nelly that he is a changed man. He no longer has the will to live but yearns for only one thing.",

You have already taken away all my land, all my wealth!' She also accused Heathcliff of taking away Hatter's land and wealth. Heathcliff became furious and left. Later, he found Cathy and Hatter studying together. Surprisingly, Heathcliff did not fly into a rage. Instead, he told Nelly, 'Everything is prepared.
