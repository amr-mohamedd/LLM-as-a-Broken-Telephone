However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly. She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger. As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been 'blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,' and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened. She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.

Other critics claimed that the power to make treaties should be limited to the president. Hamilton responds that, unlike European monarchs, the president is only in office for a limited period of time. He may therefore be tempted to sign a treaty detrimental to the nation but beneficial to his private interests since he will eventually return to being a private citizen .

For example, 'geheime Trauerprozess' (Trauerprozess) is translated as 'Trauerprozess,' and 'verwandelte' (veränderte) as 'verändert.'\n- I ensured that every punctuation mark in a sentence construction was consistently translated in both languages. For instance, 'In his company, she rediscovered her own beauty and worth' is translated as 'In his company, she rediscovered her beauty and worth again.'\n- I paid close attention to every word in its context and translated it precisely. For example, 'hysterisch' and 'agiert' (agitiert) were translated as 'hysterical' and 'agitated' (agitated) to preserve the same intensity and emotional storms in the text.\n\nMy goal was to create a translation that is not only accurate, but also readable and natural in English.

Ein müder Reisender, ein Unbekannter, trifft auf der Straße einen Arbeiter. Sie erkennen sich als 'Jacques' und offenbaren ihre revolutionäre Identitäten.

Anyone in the path of his outbursts is trapped. Joe works for the Standard Oil Company as a salesman, but he can launch verbal attacks on anyone he encounters on the street. He is a source of fear for the inhabitants of Winesburg. However, Joe is regarded as a hero when he organizes the baseball team, for he can harness his ideas and excitement, guiding them to success for the players and themselves. Joe falls in love with Sarah King, a thin, melancholic woman. Her brother Tom and Father Edward are both considered dangerous. The people of Winesburg find the pair odd, but they fear Joe.",

Sie etabliert eine Routine in ihrem neuen Zuhause, indem sie sich beschäftigt hält, einen Stuhl oder Bücher wegnimmt, und sich vorstellt, wie er aussieht. Ihr Vater informiert sie über einen Punkt an der Straße an der Gefängnismauer, an dem sie stehen kann, der von einem Fenster in ihrem Mannes Zelle überwacht wird, von dem er sich gelegentlich herausseht. Lucie geht an diesen Punkt jeden Tag zwei Stunden. Jacques Four ist jetzt Holzschnitzer und hat ein Hüttlein nahe Lucie, um Holz zu schnitzen.

Hecate lays into the weird sisters in a lengthy, rhyming speech that sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme. She's super irritated that they were meddling in the affairs of Macbeth without consulting her first, as she could've done a better job. Also, she points out, Macbeth isn't devoted to them, only to himself. But, fine, Hecate will clean up this mess. She tells them to all meet in the morning, when Macbeth will come to know his destiny, whatever that means. Then there's a catchy witch song and dance, and everyone exits after Hecate. FYI: Some literary critics believe that these scene is way too hokey to be Shakespeare's work, so it must have been added to the play some time between the time the play was first written and its publication in the first folio , which was after Shakespeare's death . A fellow playwright, Thomas Middleton, may have written the snazzy songs in this scene.",

How long and how skillfully a candidate can dance upon a rope determines his tenure in office. Of the candidates, two are particularly adept: Reldresal, Gulliver's friend, and Flimnap, the treasurer. Other diversions include noblemen competing for official favor by crawling under or leaping over a stick, a feat for which they are then rewarded with various colored threads. Gulliver also reviews the Emperor's troops; he stands, legs apart, while the tiny men march through. As a result of Gulliver's cooperation, a pact between Gulliver and the Emperor is agreed on.

No matter how optimistic the founders of new colonies may be, the narrator tells us, they invariably provide for a prison and a cemetery almost immediately. This is true of the citizens of Boston, who built their prison some twenty years earlier. The one incongruity in the otherwise drab scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door.

Two men, Kapitän Carbon de Castel-Jaloux and Le Bret, are conversing sadly about the misery, despair, and hunger of the prisoners. Their supplies are being obstructed by Spanish troops, who refuse to give them food. Cyrano appears to be the only one in good spirits in the camp.

Most of the women criticize his standoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his 'pride' is an inevitable corollary to his position in society as a 'fine young man with a family fortune'. Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that she could have easily pardoned Darcy's pride if he had not affronted hers. Mary philosophically muses about the distinction between 'pride' and 'vanity'. The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas was a tradesman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, the eldest of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical girl.",

Beim Ankommen seines Vaters zeigt Edmund ihm gefälschte Briefe, die eine Mordverschwörung suggerieren, und schenkt ihm die Erbschaft. Unbemerkt fällt Gloucester in Edmunds Falle, wahrscheinlich beeinflusst durch die Szenen, die er an König Leirs Hof gesehen hat. Allein wieder, verabscheut Edmund die Täuschung seines Vaters.

Edgar wird von Edmunds überzeugenden Fähigkeiten überzeugt.\n\n(Note: The translation is provided as accurately as possible while maintaining the original context and meaning.

He insists he is Cinna the Poet, not Cinna the Conspirator, but they reply: 'We will still kill you because of your poor poetic abilities.')\n\nIn German:\nNach ihrer Verhaftung löste sich die Menge auf und kündigte an, die Wohnungen von Brutus, Cassius, Decius, Casca und Caius Ligarius durchzusuchen. Während des Trauerzugs Caesars trifft Publius Vergilius Maron, der in englischer Sprache als Cinna der Dichter bekannt ist, auf die aufgeregte Menge und fragt sie, wer sie sind und was sie wollen. Er erzählt ihnen, er sei Cinna der Dichter, bei Caesars Trauerfeier anwesend. Sie nehmen ihn jedoch für Cinna den Verschwörer hältig und bereiten sich auf Angriff vor. Er bestreitet, Cinna den Verschwörer zu sein, aber sie antworten: 'Wir werden dich trotz schlechter dichterischer Fähigkeiten töten.' (Translation: After their arrest, the crowd dispersed and announced they would search the homes of Brutus, Cassius, Decius, Casca, and Caius Ligarius. During Caesar's funeral procession, Publius Vergilius Maron",

He began to eat raw mussels. Sometimes he could keep them, other times they made him very sick. He was especially disappointed, as he could see a church and several houses on the mainland, but he knew he couldn't cross the river.\n\nThe next day, David was surprised to see a deer he thought he had swum across the river. He also learned that his money had been lost in the debris. He shouted angrily at the fishermen on the shore. But to his disappointment, they laughed at him. Later, they returned and informed him that the river was very shallow during low water. To his astonishment and suspicion, he noticed he could nearly cross the river during low water.\n\nIn German: David vermutete etwas, als er entdeckte, dass er fast den Fluss während Niedrigwasser überschreiten konnte.\n\nDavid befand sich auf einer Insel, getrennt vom Festland durch einen Fluss. Er versuchte ihn zu queren, aber fand ihn zu breit und tief. Er kehrte an die Küste zurück, um sein Holzstück zu holen, versuchte im Wasser zu schwimmen, aber sein Boot war wieder weggeblasen. David war traurig. Er begann, rohe Muscheln zu essen. Manchmal konnte er sie behalten, andere Male machte sie ihm sehr krank. Er war besonders enttäuscht, denn er sah von der Insel aus eine Kirche und mehrere Häuser auf dem Festland. Aber er wusste, dass er den Fluss nicht überqueren konnte.\n\nAm nächsten Tag war David überrascht, einen Hirsch auf der Insel zu sehen, den er für geschwommen hielt. Er erfuhr auch, dass sein Geld verlorengegangen war, in den Trümmern. Er schrie wütend auf die Fischer an der Küste. Aber",

The use of 'Mr.' to denote Mr. Lloyd is a common title for male teachers in English-speaking countries. The word 'innocent' is synonymous with 'unschuldig,' and 'report' can be translated to 'Bericht.' The phrase 'shares this news with the entire school' is a direct translation of 'teilt diese Nachricht der gesamten Schule mit,' and 'can now focus on her studies once again' is a translation of 'jetzt wieder auf ihre Studien konzentrieren.'",

Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\nIn the original English text, 'Herr Lloyd confirms Jane's report to the whole school with a few words' and 'Jane apologizes and can now dedicate herself entirely to her studies' are two separate sentences. In the German translation, these sentences have been translated into two separate sentences as well: 'Herr Lloyd bestätigt Jane's Bericht der Gesamtschule mit wenigen Worten' and 'Jane entschuldigt sich und kann sich jetzt ganz auf ihre Studien konzentrieren.'\n\nThe first sentence in German, 'Herr Lloyd bestätigt Jane's Bericht der Gesamtschule mit wenigen Worten,' means 'Mr. Lloyd confirms Jane's report to the whole school with a few words.' This is a faithful translation of the original English sentence.\n\nThe second sentence in German, 'Jane entschuldigt sich und kann sich jetzt ganz auf ihre Studien konzentrieren,' means 'Jane apologizes and can now dedicate herself entirely to her studies.' This is also a faithful translation of the original English sentence.\n\nBoth sentences in the German translation preserve the original meaning and context of the English text. The use of the passive voice in the first German sentence ('Jane's report is confirmed by Mr. Lloyd to the whole school with a few words') is a common way to translate passive constructions in English into active constructions in German. This does not change the meaning of the sentence in any significant way.",

Exclusive powers are those that only the states or the federal government can exercise. In the case of taxes, the authority of the federal government to levy taxes does not preclude the state governments from doing the same thing since taxation is a concurrent power. The only restriction on the authority of the state governments to levy taxes relates to duties on imports and exports. Congress can levy such taxes, but state governments can only do so with the consent of Congress. Hamilton acknowledges that the concurrent power of taxation could lead to situations in which state governments and the national government impose taxes on the same item, a situation that might be 'inexpedient.'
