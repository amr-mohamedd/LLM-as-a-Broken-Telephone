Armado, Moth, and Costard enter; Armado tells the scholars that the King has asked for a 'pleasant pastime, or show, or spectacle, or interlude' to be organized for the Princess and her retinue. He asks Holofernes and Nathaniel for help in planning this pastime, and Holofernes suggests they create a piece based on the Nine Worthies. They discuss which roles the Worthies will play, with Holofernes stating that he himself will take on three roles. They leave to plan their piece.\n\nTranslation:\n\nHolofernes en Nathaniel praten over Don Armado, met wie Nathaniel gesproken heeft. Ze spotten zijn ondergeschikte intelligentie aan, kritiserend zijn taalgebruik en bevestigden dat ze 'zulke ongeordende schrijvers' haaten. Armado, Moth en Costard binnentreden; Armado vertelt de geleerden dat de Koning een 'aangenaam vermaak, of show, of spektakel, of interlude' heeft gevraagd om voor de Prinses en haar gevolg te organiseren. Hij vraagt Holofernes en Nathaniel om hun hulp bij het planning van dit vermaak, en Holofernes voorschlagt dat ze een stukje maken gebaseerd op de Negen Edelen. Ze bespreken dan welke rollen de Edelen zullen spelen, waarbij Holofernes zegt dat hij zelf drie rollen zal opnemen. Ze vertrekken om hun stuk te planningen.\n\n(Note: In this translation, I assumed the source language to be English.

Ermengarde goes on about how clever Sara must be because she can speak French. Sara does what any child would upon making a friend --she asks Ermengarde if she'd like to meet Emily, her doll. When she starts to tell fantastical stories about Emily, Ermengarde is amazed at how she's able to just make things up on the fly. Suddenly, Sara looks like she's in pain. Ermengarde asks her what is up with that, and Sara responds that she's in pain because she misses her father. Then, Ermengarde asks Sara if she'd like to be her best friend. Which is not weird at all. Sara agrees. Yay, BFF!",

They address each other as 'Jacques' to indicate their status as revolutionaries. The mender of roads directs the man to the chateau of the murdered Marquis. Later that night, the man sets the castle on fire. A rider from the chateau urges the village soldiers to help put out the fire and salvage the valuables there, but they refuse, and the villagers go inside their homes and put 'candles in every dull little pane of glass. The peasants nearly kill Gabelle, the local tax collector, but he escapes to the roof of his house, where he watches the chateau burn.

Today, we will discuss innovative approaches to renewable energy sources and their implementation in our daily lives. I am pleased to introduce our first keynote speaker, Professor Jan van Dijk from the University of Amsterdam.'\n\nB. 'Professor van Dijk, the floor is yours.'\n\nII. Keynote speech by Professor Jan van Dijk:\nA. 'Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests. I am honored to be here today to talk about the latest developments in solar energy technology. Solar energy is becoming increasingly important in our quest for sustainable energy solutions. The Netherlands, with its abundant sunshine, is an ideal place for the implementation of solar energy.'\n\nB. 'Recent advancements in solar cell technology have led to significant improvements in efficiency and cost. For instance, the development of perovskite solar cells has shown a remarkable increase in efficiency, making them a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells.'\n\nC. 'Moreover, the integration of solar energy into our daily lives is becoming more accessible and affordable. Solar panels can now be installed on rooftops, and solar power can be stored in batteries for use during peak hours or when the sun is not shining. This decentralization of energy production is a game-changer in the energy sector.'\n\nIII. Q&A session:\nA. 'Question from the audience: What about the environmental impact of producing solar panels? Are they truly sustainable?'\n\nB. 'Professor van Dijk: That's a valid concern. While the production of solar panels does require some resources and energy, the environmental impact is significantly lower than that of traditional energy sources. Moreover, the environmental footprint of solar panels is decreasing as technology advances and production methods improve.'\n\nC. 'Question from the audience: What are the main challenges in implementing solar energy on a larger scale?'\n\nD. 'Professor van Dijk: One of the main challenges is the intermittency of solar energy. Solar panels produce energy only when the sun is shining, so energy storage and grid integration are crucial for a stable energy supply. Additionally, the initial investment for solar panel installation can be high, but the long-term savings and environmental benefits make it a",

They fight their way off the stage as Achilles and Hector show up, going at it with their swords. Hector is getting the better of Achilles and offers to let the guy take a break.

Hector says he really likes the guy's armor and wouldn't mind having it in his trophy case. Then he runs after the shiny trophy.",

As Dinah begins to preach, she draws in the villagers with her soft, loving voice, and the stranger stays to listen to her despite his reservations about a woman preacher. Dinah's sermon tells about the love Jesus has for the poor and encourages the townspeople to give up their sins and do good in the world.

She calls for a servant to summon a haruspex to read the signs and asks Caesar to stay home. The servant returns and confirms Calpurnia's words to Caesar. Later, Caesar tells Antony about his illness. Decius Brutus enters and reads the signs, which foretell that Caesar will die in Roman blood. Decius repeats Calpurnia's dream of Caesar's death in Roman blood. Decius predicts that the Senate is hidden. Caesar changes his plans and goes to see the Centurion for advice. Caesar arrives and greets Antony, who still experiences the unsettling feelings of the previous night.\n\nTranslation:\n\nAt the outset of the occurrence, the scene initially unfolds within Caesar's residence. The night is tempestuous, and Calpurnia has had a dream that Caesar has perished. She summons a servant to bring in a haruspex to interpret the omens and urges Caesar to remain at home. The servant returns and corroborates Calpurnia's account to Caesar. Subsequently, Caesar shares with Antony his ailment. Decius Brutus makes an entrance and peruses the omens, which foreshadow Caesar's demise in Roman blood. Decius recounts Calpurnia's dream of Caesar's death in Roman blood. Decius prophesies that the Senate is concealed. Caesar alters his intentions and seeks counsel from the Centurion. Caesar arrives and salutes Antony, who continues to grapple with the uneasy emotions of the preceding night.",

Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks.

They had waffles and sausages for breakfast. Jake tells them that the Shimerdas are satisfied with their gifts, including Ambrosch. In the afternoon, Jake and Jim play marbles. Otto writes a letter to his mother, just as he does every Christmas morning. At four o'clock, Mr. Shimerda comes with his roller skates and winter clothing. He comes to thank them for all they have done for his family. He seems proud, although it is a brief interruption in his unbroken sadistic behavior. At nine o'clock, he leaves to go home. Before he leaves, he says 'Good morning' to Grandma and compliments her as a good woman. He adds that the prayers of all good people are effective.\n\n(Note: The English translation preserves the original meaning and context of the passage.)",

Despite the founders' optimistic intentions for the new colonies, the storyteller tells us, they will always build a prison and a cemetery. This is also true for the inhabitants of Boston, who built their prison about twenty years ago. The only unexpected element in the otherwise dark scene is the rosebush that grows next to the prison door. The storyteller suspects that he reminds the condemned of the Natural Grace; for his tale, he will give them a 'sweet moral flower' or something else to comfort them in the face of endless sorrow and darkness.\n\n(Note: In this translation, I have attempted to preserve the original meaning and context while maintaining a formal and literary style typical of English.)",

Zij schoonmaakte het huis van Banker White. Tom had vroeger als paardenschilder gewerkt bij het huis van de White's, maar omdat hij daar verveeld en onbetrouwbaar was, verloor hij die baan. Nu doet hij verschillende kleine taken en is hij erg gelukkig. Zij komt regelmatig om zijn huurkamers te schoonmaken, en hij heeft een vreemde, bewuste benadering van levenservaringen. Hij wil zaken doen, maar hij selecteert bepaalde ervaringen en leeft ze uit bewust. Bijvoorbeeld, na zich in Helen White te zijn verliefd, beperkt hij zijn gedachten over haar. Een avond besluit hij dat het waard is om te drinken en probeert het. Hij koopt een fles whiskey en gaat ongeveer een mijl noordelijk van de stad, waar hij zich op een grasbank zit en dronken raakt.

Fogg wished to take the ship to Liverpool. Everything went well for the first few days and then the ship got caught in a gale. The ship has to fight the wind and they lose time as a result. Also since the ship had been traveling on full steam the vessel runs out of coal, as fuel. Fogg nevertheless asks the engineer to run the ship on full steam.

When the First Senator denies any knowledge of a military leak, Aufidius produces a letter that he had received four days earlier stating that the Romans have raised an army against the Volscians under the leadership of Cominius, Marcius, and Titus Lartius. The letter also states that the Roman citizens are rebelling. To dispel some of Aufidius anger, the Second Senator makes him a general for the battle. Aufidius closes the scene by commenting that if he and Marcius should meet on the battlefield, there is sure to be a fight to death.",
