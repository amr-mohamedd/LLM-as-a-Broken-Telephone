In a statement on Tuesday, the theme park in Chertsey, Surrey, said: 'She may have needed a momentary pause after the most epic of launch events, but she's back in full flight'. The theme park said the ride will reopen to guests on Wednesday.\n\nHyperia is 236ft (72m) tall and has a top speed of 81mph (130km/h). The theme park said the closure followed 'standard technical pre-opening procedure checks', but has not given further details.\n\n'One again we want to thank everyone for their understanding and patience,' a Thorpe Park spokesperson said. The theme park had previously told guests that it was unable to commit to reopening Hyperia before 8 June, adding last week that it was not possible to open the ride on that date.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

The 36-year-old American won by unanimous decision at the BMO Stadium to extend his unbeaten record to 41 fights. A former lightweight world champion who was also undisputed champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, Crawford triumphed 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113 on the judges' scorecards. Defeat was the first of 29-year-old Uzbek Madrimov's 11-bout career.\n\n'Israil was a tough competitor,' said Crawford, who had not been taken to 12 rounds since 2016. 'He's real strong. He's durable. He took a lot of good shots. He got me to round 12. 'He had fast speed, a good rhythm upstairs. He was very disciplined and he fought a good fight. 'I was being patient. I didn't want to rush in with anything. That's how I got caught a couple times - I tried to eat too soon.' Crawford's win opened up the possibility of a fight with Mexico's super-middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez. 'If the money is right, we've got to fight,' said Crawford.\n• None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.'

In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",

They can also attack again from elsewhere, with a force that is lacking in time.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen has seen this Christmas shows that Iran and Israel lack understanding of each other.\n\nThis may be just a minor reminder in Iran in the province of Isfahan, which has impressive Islamic art buildings, but also a nuclear plant, a large air base, and major industries, including aircraft and missile production plants.\n\nThis attack may be over, but at this time, the widespread hatred between the two competing superpowers in this region is still present.",
