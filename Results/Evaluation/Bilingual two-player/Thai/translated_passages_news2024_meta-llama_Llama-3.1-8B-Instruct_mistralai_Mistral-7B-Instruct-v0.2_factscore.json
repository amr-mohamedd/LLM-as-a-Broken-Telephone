While per capita GDP is now also up for the first time in two years, it is still lower now than two years ago.\n\nWill people be grateful for a turning point? Or will they focus on years of sluggish growth and declining living standards before that?\n\nThe economic hangover from the worst health crisis in a century and the worst energy crisis in a generation was always going to be tough, but the economy now appears to be returning to normal. If sustained, that is a marked improvement.\n\nAnd with that, we're closing our live coverage.

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

Donal Hawyard from the Labour Formation came in third place with 6,773 points.\n\nThis unexpected victory in the last election was a result of Jorje's determination to break the 6,000 point threshold, which received support from the Labour Party regarding the issue in Kasay. The party decided to withdraw support for a candidate, which was Azar Ali, due to his controversial speech. After winning the election in that month, Jorje said, 'Starmer and Sunak are two sides of the same coin, and both have been significantly affected.' Jorje represented the Labour Party until 2003 and served as a representative for the Independent and Respect parties in the three electoral districts between 2003 and 2015.\n\nDo you have any questions for the new government?",

In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",

They may attack again in various places using different forces.\n\nAccording to my colleague Jane Buettner, this argument is truly a sign that Etaharan and Israel do not understand each other.\n\nIt may be a warning shot aimed at the heart of Etaharan, a significant Islamic cultural site, but there are also industrial production sites, important airports, commercial areas of value, and factories producing unmanned aircraft and remote weapons.\n\nThis situation may have come to an end, but the dissatisfaction between the two parties in the region remains unabated.",
