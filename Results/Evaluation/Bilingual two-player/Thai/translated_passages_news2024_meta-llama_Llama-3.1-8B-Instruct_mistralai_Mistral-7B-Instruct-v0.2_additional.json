The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: 'no'.\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: 'Robust'. It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses.

He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is 'bluffing'.\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months.

Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",

The party decided to withdraw support for a candidate, which was Azar Ali, due to his controversial speech. After winning the election in that month, Jorje said, 'Starmer and Sunak are two sides of the same coin, and both have been significantly affected.'

The small ceramic animal, which had been treasured for 55 years by Canadian Raymond Patten, was auctioned in Staffordshire on Tuesday. It was given to him on his 21st birthday by a great aunt who worked as a cook at Cambridge University. 'I believe she knew the future King on a personal basis. I have treasured the goat all my life,' Mr Patten said.\n\nMr Patten said his aunt 'told me Prince Charles had made it'. He added: 'She was proud of the fact he attended Cambridge University in the late 1960s when she worked as a cook for the president of Queens' College.' Charles Hanson, of Hansons Auctioneers, added: 'Raymond decided to part with the goat due to its historical significance. 'He is in his retirement years and wanted to find it a new home where it would be treasured for decades to come.'

In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.\n\nMany had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.\n\nBut as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.\n\nThis may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.\n\nThis round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.",
