Gloucestershire Police said officers were called to reports of the crash involving two cars at about 10:45 BST on Saturday on the A4019 Tewkesbury Road in Cheltenham. The force said the 'serious' crash happened on the bridge at junction 10 of the M5 and people inside the cars were being treated by paramedics. The road closure was in place for several hours on the A4019 between Cheltenham and Coombe Hill. It reopened just before 15:00 BST.\n\nThis follows another crash on the A433 Tetbury Road in Cirencester, involving two vehicles.

Andrew Bailey said he was 'optimistic that things are moving in the right direction' as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall 'close' to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been 'encouraging news' on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%.

Staff tried to intervene to separate the primates but they were unable to save 31-year-old Rene. A second chimpanzee was also injured during the incident last week and had to be operated on. A zoo spokesperson said: 'This type of behaviour occurs in the wild, especially around breeding time when females are in season and when males are challenging for dominance of the group.'\n\nA second chimpanzee, Qafzeh, required an operation for his injuries. He is said to be doing well and is gradually being reintroduced to the group. The statement concluded: 'Rene was a huge personality and will be missed by those who cared for him.' Edinburgh Zoo, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 chimpanzees. The primates live in one enclosure called the Budongo Trail.",

Zoo staff attempted to intervene and separate the animals, but it was too late. Another mandrill, Qafzeh, was also injured during the same altercation and is currently undergoing rehabilitation. A zoo spokesperson stated: 'These behaviors generally occur outside the enclosure, particularly during the breeding season when females are in heat and males compete for dominance of the group.'\n\nWe hope Qafzeh's health improves and that he can be gradually reintroduced into the group. The statement concluded by saying: 'René was a key figure, and he will be deeply missed by those who cared for him.' The Scottish zoo, managed by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, is home to 15 mandrills. The primates live in an exhibit area called the Budongo Trail.",

Sven Yoro, who joined the team this season but was unable to make his competitive debut due to a foot injury during the pre-season, is back with the squad.\n\nChristian Eriksen and Mason Mount returned to Manchester United after their 2-0 victory in the Europa League against PAOK on Thursday. The players had not been present since February due to a foot injury they contracted in August, initially expected to return after the international break in October. However, coach Erik ten Hag stated: 'it wasn't in the plans.'\n\nShaw, who had missed Manchester United's matches since February due to a similar injury, was with the England team for the Euro 2024 but missed the group stages due to this injury. He came on as a substitute in the final against Spain.\n\nManchester United missed Shaw's presence in the team for the rest of the 2022-23 season.",

At the time, he was distracted by his mobile phone.\n\nFootage from cameras installed on his feet, taken before and after the scene, shows that just before taking a bend and passing under the hedges, Catterall was looking at his mobile phone instead of the road.\n\nBefore the incident, Catterall had stopped near a crashed car and a river where there were three people and a dog.\n\nCatterall pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and excessive use of his mobile phone at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court. He was sentenced to an eight-month suspended prison term, 150 hours of community service, a three-month driving ban, and a one-year suspension of his driving license.\n\nNote: In the British legal system, a suspended prison sentence is a prison sentence that is not immediately executed but can be activated if the offender is convicted of another offence within a specified period.",

            "text": "George Galloway was not at the count in Rochdale\n\nVeteran left-winger George Galloway has lost the Rochdale seat he won only four months ago in a stunning by-election victory. The Workers Party of Britain founder did not attend the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre to hear the general election result. Reform UK's Michael Howard came third, with 6,773 votes.\n\nIt was a huge turnaround from Mr Galloway's landslide by-election victory, when he tapped into anger about Labour's stance on the conflict in Gaza to win by more than 6,000 votes. His campaign in February was hugely boosted by Labour's decision to withdraw support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. After his victory earlier this year, Mr Galloway said: 'Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked.' Mr Galloway was a Labour MP until 2003, before sitting in the Commons as an independent and Respect Party MP for three constituencies between 2003 and 2015.\n\nWhat questions do you have for the new government?",
