But the thorough nature of an inquiry like this ensures it can still shock.\n\nTake a four-minute exchange at just after 11 this morning. The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: \"no\".\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: \"Robust\". It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses. The stage has been set for the next act of this, still shocking, drama.",

    "0_en": "Bank needs to see more evidence before cutting rates, says governor\n\nReporting from the Bank of England\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England says it needs to \"see more evidence\" that price rises have slowed further before cutting interest rates. Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\" as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall \"close\" to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been \"encouraging news\" on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. \"We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,\" he said.",
