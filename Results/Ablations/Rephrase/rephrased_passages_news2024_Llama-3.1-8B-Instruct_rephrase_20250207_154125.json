    "100_en": "A devastating car crash took place on the M5 bridge in Gloucestershire, prompting a swift response from the authorities to safeguard the welfare and safety of all individuals involved. The accident occurred around 10:45 BST on a Saturday near junction 10 of the M5, prompting the authorities to swiftly close the A4019 Tewkesbury Road in Cheltenham to prevent potential hazards from affecting other drivers. To guarantee the safety of motorists, traffic was redirected around the affected area, and emergency responders arrived promptly to provide medical assistance to those affected by the accident. To maintain public safety and prevent further incidents, the police advised drivers to use alternative routes while the A4019 was closed between Cheltenham and Coombe Hill for a short period. The road reopened just before 15:00 BST after a brief closure. Notably, this accident occurred shortly after another two-vehicle collision on the A433 Tetbury Road in Cirencester. The police are now appealing to anyone who witnessed the A4019 crash to come forward and make contact with them."

Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\" as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall \"close\" to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been \"encouraging news\" on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. \"We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,\" he said.",
