But the thorough nature of an inquiry like this ensures it can still shock.\n\nTake a four-minute exchange at just after 11 this morning. The campaigner Lord Arbuthnot recalled a meeting where he was, once again, told by the Post Office there were no issues with the Horizon IT system.\n\nJason Beer KC then listed various bugs and acquittals and cancelled investigations and asked if the former MP had been told about them at that meeting. Time after time the response came: \"no\".\n\nAnother word has been repeated a lot today: \"Robust\". It was the way Post Office officials described that bug-ridden system.\n\nThe man in charge of a short-lived mediation scheme - retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper - said that, looking back, there was never a chance of resolution so long as Post Office bosses 'robustly' maintained there was nothing wrong with Horizon.\n\nTomorrow, we start hearing from those former Post Office bosses. The stage has been set for the next act of this, still shocking, drama.",

The Japanese military is supplying the evacuees with essential items like food, water, and blankets following the earthquake.\n\nAt first, a severe tsunami warning was issued, but it was later downgraded to a warning, and eventually to an advisory."

    "0_en": "The boat was overcrowded, with more clambering on\n\nOn the north coast of France\n\nThe French police had struggled to stop the migrants as they’d charged from the dark sand dunes towards the sea. Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

We're now wrapping up our live coverage.\n\nHis brief testimony lasted just four minutes, which took us all a bit by surprise here in the newsroom.\n\nThe short time on the stand was because Judge Lewis Kaplan had given Trump a very limited scope of what he could talk about. A separate trial last year found Trump sexually assaulted Carroll, so it meant he couldn't repeat his denials and had to stick to what was relevant in the case.\n\nCourt returns tomorrow for closing arguments and the jury to be sent off for deliberations.

    "0_en": "Bank needs to see more evidence before cutting rates, says governor\n\nReporting from the Bank of England\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England says it needs to \"see more evidence\" that price rises have slowed further before cutting interest rates. Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\" as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall \"close\" to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been \"encouraging news\" on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. \"We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,\" he said.",
