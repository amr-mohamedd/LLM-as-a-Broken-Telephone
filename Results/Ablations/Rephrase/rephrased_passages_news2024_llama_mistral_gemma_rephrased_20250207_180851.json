Several young men turned round to face the police, brandishing long sticks, and throwing flares or firecrackers. Two women with a child, who could not keep up with the group, were stopped by the police on the shoreline. One said she was from Iraq and was desperate to join her family in the UK. Once the migrants had boarded the inflatable boat they’d been dragging across the sand, the police made no further attempt to stop them. At one point the overloaded boat appeared to be beached on a sand bar by the retreating tide, but then it moved further out to sea. We waited as the light grew stronger and could see that several small rescue boats had been launched from a large French maritime rescue ship off the coast. The rescue boats seemed to circle the now distant inflatable boat for a time. It was only hours later that we learnt that there were dead onboard the inflatable.",

They can be found in many common household items from bicarbonate of soda to drain cleaner.\n\nBut not all of these substances are harmful to human health - it depends how strong they are.\n\nWeak alkalis are unlikely to cause any harm. In fact they can be consumed - such as baking soda in cakes.\n\nIt is products that contain strong alkalis like sodium hydroxide that cause damage , these are most commonly used in strong household cleaners and the paper industry.\n\nA common misconception is that is it only acids which are corrosive, but strong alkalis like this can also cause serious damage to humans.\n\nDepending on how long you are exposed, the type of exposure (ingestion or skin contact) and the dose it can cause severe burns to tissue, accumulation of fluid in the lungs and blindness.",

We're closing our coverage now, but before we go here's a recap from today's show.\n\nWe heard from Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who acknowledged that families have been let down over decades by the infected blood scandal, though he wouldn't be drawn on the amount of compensation due.\n\nOn Ukraine he said the west \"took its eye off the ball\" and he doesn't want a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nShadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting outlined plans to cut NHS waiting lists and said a future Labour government would ensure victims of the infected blood scandal are compensated.\n\nWe also had an interview with Leonid Volkov, former aide to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He says he doesn't think a Putin victory is possible and that the Russian president is \"bluffing\".\n\nOur panel today were journalist Piers Morgan, climate campaigner Mikaela Loach and former Tory donor and businessman David Ross.\n\nThis page was written by Gabriela Pomeroy, Kathryn Armstrong and Lou Newton, and edited by me.\n\nSee you next week.\n• You can continue reading here: Infected blood victims have waited too long, says Grant Shapps",

Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\" as rates were held at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the sixth time in a row. Bailey says the Bank expects inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, will fall \"close\" to its 2% target in the next couple of months. It paves the way for a first interest cut to be made in the summer, possibly as early as June if inflation falls as predicted. Bailey said there had been \"encouraging news\" on inflation, which official figures last month showed had fallen further to 3.2%. \"We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,\" he said.",

The Bank anticipates that inflation, which gauges price increases, will approach its 2% objective in the upcoming months. This development may lead to the first rate reduction in the summer, potentially as soon as June, should inflation decrease as anticipated.
